Today started out a little imperfectly– I didn&#8217;t jump out of bed the way I wanted to. (I wrote about that this morning!) But then I watched a motivational video on the way to work to get my mood up, and then I stayed quite focused from task to task before lunch. After lunch I was a bit lethargic, but I didn&#8217;t completely fall of the wagon. I did have a couple of meetings to prepare for, which I did. I wrote down each thing I did in a notebook that I keep at work, and so I got a bunch of things done. I would say that was maybe a 6.8/10 in terms of productivity, which I can live with. Pretty good for a meeting-filled Monday.

A couple of silly things happened– I had given my wife my keys because she couldn&#8217;t find hers, and we both assumed she&#8217;d be home before me. Then I lost my ATM card, and I didn&#8217;t have any cash in my wallet (because she had borrowed the 50 that I had left in it, and hadn&#8217;t replaced the change). So due to a bunch of seemingly unrelated things, I ended up near home but without my keys, without money, and without the ATM cards I&#8217;d need to withdraw money. So I was hungry for a while. I chose to be a little meditative about it, thinking about how there were certainly times in the past when I was in school or in the Army when I was broke and hungry. I could always have asked my parents for money, but I didn&#8217;t want to. I was often wasting money on things like cigarettes, or maybe staying out too late with friends and then having to take cabs home. So it wasn&#8217;t like I was in a genuinely bad state in life, I was just in momentarily blips of poor-finances-induced-hunger. I hadn&#8217;t experienced that for a few years. It was interesting to feel hungry again that way– not knowing when my wife would get back. I mean, it was a tiny, tiny fragment of what genuinely broke people feel, not pretending to suddenly relate to people&#8217;s struggles or anything.

But despite that, I got home, relaxed for a while, showered, and then found myself on reddit/Imgur as I normally do when I feel like I have time. The wife&#8217;s in the shower. It&#8217;s 10:43pm. And something compelled me to stop my reddit/imguring (worst time sink right now– I&#8217;ve even blocked them on my browser, and end up opening an incognito tab &#8220;just for a few seconds&#8221;). I don&#8217;t think I spent too long on it, could be worse. As long as I do a vomit and go to bed, I think I come out on top. Well&#8230; a part of me wanted to go for another run. But I think I&#8217;m due for a rest anyway. Today felt like I got a reasonable number of things done. If I can spend every day with this level of productivity– get a few tasks done, at least one important one, and at least one nagging task that&#8217;s been bothering me for a while, and respond to correspondence quickly as it comes, rather than letting it linger– I think I&#8217;ll be quite happy.  So we can proceed with that. If I go to bed now I should be up fairly early. And then I can plan my day and focus.

What I mentioned earlier and what I&#8217;m thinking about more is– how I ought to &#8220;Do It Now&#8221;. I know &#8220;Just Do It&#8221; sounds nicer than &#8220;Just Do It Now&#8221;, but I do think the &#8220;Now&#8221; bit is particularly powerful. As I was exploring in the procrastination posts earlier- the central thing about procrastination (or one of the central things) is &#8220;pleasure now pain later&#8221;. Procrastinators a problem where we&#8217;re always underestimating how bad the pain will be later. Systematically, over and over again. We overestimate how much energy and clarity of mind we&#8217;ll have later, hoping that last minute panic will force everything to be crystal clear. (Which can sometimes happen, but then you also find that you&#8217;re forced into a corner where you see how things should be but only have the time/resources/energy to do 10-20% of it. Cue mixed feelings. Over and over again.)

Also there&#8217;s the sense that doing something now is painful. When I wake up in the morning, getting out of bed NOW seems like an insurmountable task. I just can&#8217;t seem to do it– except when I&#8217;m in the military and there are other guys jumping out of bed and there&#8217;s alarms going off and we gotta rush down and there&#8217;ll be a miserable, immediate consequence if we screw it up. I was wondering– how do you get better at waking up? The person who&#8217;s waking up is, prior to waking up, asleep. And I have very little agency and control over myself when I&#8217;m asleep. So the action has to be taken subconsciously. And so far it seems I&#8217;m fairly decent (not perfect– I still screw this up) at waking up when the alarm goes off. Then I turn it off and linger in bed. And fall asleep.

It&#8217;s the lingering that kills me. I&#8217;ve always been a lingerer. I used to linger on the premises after school, maybe because I didn&#8217;t really want to go home. I didn&#8217;t really want to have to confront things. I&#8217;ve always hated and/or disliked confrontations. I don&#8217;t really like meetings even now. I&#8217;m alright at public speaking, surprisingly, but I have a lot of dread towards a lot of things. I&#8217;m not entirely sure why. I have all these expectations. I feel so aware of all the things that can and will go wrong.

I don&#8217;t want to over-psycho-analyze myself, at least not right now. It&#8217;s more important to recover from the wound than to keep digging at it, asking &#8220;why is this wound here? who did this to me? how did it happen?&#8221; So I think I just need to develop the habit of doing things immediately, as fast as possible. I mean, I can see how there might be an opposite extreme. But I think that won&#8217;t be an issue. Let&#8217;s just move fast and see how it goes.
