Getting glazed over at work:

Often after lunch, I have a post-lunch &#8216;crash&#8217; where I&#8217;m all lethargic. This is worse if I didn&#8217;t have breakfast in the morning– again, something that happens if I didn&#8217;t sleep and wake early the day before. But what happens is&#8230; after coming back from lunch, I just start messing around instead of picking a specific thing to do. Ideally I think I should do one important work task before lunch and another one after lunch. Then maybe around 3pm or so I could take a break, before then picking one more task. That would be amazing, if I did 3 solid work tasks a day at work. I wouldn&#8217;t feel so frustrated, like I&#8217;m just doing a lot of little things that don&#8217;t really contribute to the big picture. I need to sit down and clarify how each thing contributes towards the larger picture. Otherwise it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m just rearranging cutlery. 

I think part of why I feel frustrated is that I&#8217;m not connecting the dots properly to the larger vision. Why we&#8217;re doing what we&#8217;re doing, and how my individual actions help. I should draw a little map of that. I keep approaching my work like it&#8217;s something massive and complex, but really I have a few little tasks that add up into bigger things, and I just need to break everything down into steps. This is something I&#8217;ve been putting off forever, again probably because it&#8217;ll force me to confront things that I&#8217;m not so good at, and force me to do things that might not be the most interesting, fun or easy things to do. But then and again, I&#8217;ve found that if I don&#8217;t do those important things, everything else is trivial. It&#8217;s like polishing tyres on a car that has an engine that doesn&#8217;t start. 

Leaving work:

I tend to linger at work until pretty late-ish, especially if I&#8217;ve been relatively unproductive. This is irrational– it&#8217;s me hoping that spending more time at work means that I&#8217;ll get more stuff done. Which reminds me of my experience in NS, when I used to saw away slowly and laboriously at some thick cloth that I had to cut. Turns out that hard, sharp, fast strokes cut a lot deeper than monotonous sawing. That&#8217;s how I ought to approach my work. Really hard, focused bursts rather than a general vagueness. 

I should leave work on time– maybe even a little early, if I get all my stuff done. Getting home before sunset makes me feel happy. I like seeing sunlight through my window at home, it makes me feel a little happier to be alive and a little less dark and depressed. I guess it&#8217;s just nice to be out and about in the sunlight. This is yet another reason to wake up early in the morning. I especially like being up and about before it gets too hot– that is, 7am to 9am or so. It&#8217;s nice to head out to exercise.

Commute home:

Again, I should either read a book or read something interesting, or if something&#8217;s on my mind, write a word vomit.

Shower:

I should always shower immediately when I get home. It just makes me instantly feel so much better. Sometimes what I do is&#8230; I come back and I&#8217;m tired so I lie on the sofa for a while, or I do some work (which honestly, I should complete at work itself, at least 95% of the time).

Dinner: 

When my wife was working in the same building as me, we used to have dinner out pretty regularly. I guess now that we&#8217;re apart, I typically either buy dinner home, or she prepares something before I get back. We need to sit down and figure out our meal plans in advance, otherwise we tend to default to rather unhealthy options. If we plan early, I can buy whatever groceries we might need on the way home from work. 

Which makes me think about eating healthy snacks at work. We have granola bars, somehow I haven&#8217;t gotten around to eating them very much anymore. As I think this, I realize I&#8217;m a little hungry and I should go put something in my mouth. Okay, back. Just ate a granola bar. Interesting. I realize that I don&#8217;t typically eat them as much as I ought to because they&#8217;re a little tedious to eat– they flake, and they&#8217;re a little dry and rough. But I also realize that I very quickly feel a rush of energy in my head. Which is something that will be very useful when I&#8217;m trying to do work. So I guess I should be mindful of that. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little tedious but not actually as tedious as you think, and it refuels you so you&#8217;re able to do better work, faster, be done faster, and be happier.&#8221; I should do the same for everything that I know I want to do. These things shouldn&#8217;t be reasoned decisions each time, that&#8217;s unnecessarily costly in terms of willpower. I should have these decisions made in advance– I will go to the gym because it will make me feel better and fitter and stronger and I will have earned my keep. I need to do the cost/benefit analysis in advance, rather than at the beginning of each act. 

Cleaning up:

I should always clean up after dinner, etc. I hate seeing dishes in the sink, it just makes me feel sloppy and disgusting. I like living and working in clean spaces. To my credit I think I do this more often than not. But usually if I don&#8217;t do it it&#8217;s because I postpone it to a mythical later. Postponing things is one of my greatest tragedies. 

Time-before-sleep:

If I don&#8217;t plan anything, we tend to just sit on our computers and browse nonsense on the internet. Sometimes we go out or watch a movie if we make plans, but they don&#8217;t happen nearly as much as they ought to. 

Finally, I ought to do a review of the day every night before I go to bed. And a word vomit, if anything&#8217;s on my mind. And then I should wind down with a book and go to bed. I should leave my phone and laptop outside.
