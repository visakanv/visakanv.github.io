A: I have a theory.

B: Let&#8217;s hear it.

A: I think I&#8217;ve been suffering from a mild testosterone deficiency of sorts.

B: What makes you say that?

A: Well, I remember in the few weeks right before I finally hit the gym, I was feeling very edgy and anxious– I know, I know I always describe myself as edgy and anxious, but this one was slightly different. This one&#8230; I started having weird thoughts. I felt like I wanted to fuck something– I don&#8217;t mean that in a particularly sexual sense. I felt like I needed to break something, maybe. 

B: And that&#8217;s new?

A: Well&#8230; I feel like it has something to do with me sitting at a desk at work all day, and then going on a very depressing, crushed-like-sardines commute every single day, almost 3 hours worth of that. Every day. And I come home and I&#8217;m in this little box of a house. I take some walks, and sometimes I go for a run, but I felt like I was getting really stifled. I know this is really bro-sciency, but I started feeling rather whiny and lethargic. 

And then I hit the gym– I did some big, compound movements with the barbell– just a few short, powerful sets. I could feel it in my spine. I found myself thinking about Arnold Schwarzenegger talking about how he felt like he was cumming in the gym, and how he was in heaven. 

It&#8217;s so hard to talk about this in ordinary language, it almost feels like ordinary language is a little neutered. But I&#8217;ve been feeling like I really wanted to fuck something, and somehow lifting a heavy ass weight (relative to what I normally lift– probably a puny weight to people who lift regularly) felt like it hit the spot for me. 

B: Hm. Well&#8230; you know that you don&#8217;t actually have any idea what you&#8217;re talking about, phenomenologically.

A: Yeah, which is annoying. I&#8217;m no scientist. I&#8217;m not fitness expert. I&#8217;m no nutrition expert. I don&#8217;t know shit about hormones. Everything I know is just random stuff that I&#8217;ve read from magazines and the Internet. But what I do know for a fact is that I felt a very real, physical change– and not just physical, it felt like a change in the mind. It felt like I was washing my brain, in a good way. 

B: So what are you going to do about it?

A: Well, for starters, I really feel like now is the time for me to start working out regularly. I don&#8217;t want to overwork myself, but I&#8217;m going to go roughly every 3 days. Once this crazy soreness subsides, I&#8217;m going to do it again. And then I&#8217;m going to eat heavy and put on some bloody weight.

B: Tell me more about your weight stuff.

A: Have I written about this before? I&#8217;m sure I have, but here it is again. I&#8217;ve always felt really weak and skinny, and I never really knew very much to do about it. I would go to the gym from time to time, and lift some weights. But I was always nervous about squats, because I was so weak and so unsure about how to do them. And I&#8217;d typically be afraid of lifting too heavy, in case somebody scolded me or something. I don&#8217;t know. I would spend too long in the gym, for some reason. 

And then I wouldn&#8217;t eat very much. I&#8217;ve always had bad eating habits, and back then I felt broke and I didn&#8217;t feel like I could spend a lot of money on food. And I also suppose I didn&#8217;t know how to prepare food, either. Now I could theoretically bulk up just eating lots of eggs and drinking lots of milk. I used to hate white milk, and chocolate milk leaves that chalky aftertaste that makes it hard to drink tonnes of it of&#8230; and now I&#8217;m consuming a lot more. I think.

B: So what&#8217;s changed?

A: I think I&#8217;ve gotten older and I&#8217;ve realized that I don&#8217;t want to go on like this. I don&#8217;t want to be a 25 year old skinny guy who doesn&#8217;t eat enough. I don&#8217;t want to continue to be self conscious. I want to have big muscular legs and arms and shoulders. I want people to get out of my way when I&#8217;m trying to get somewhere. I want to feel like I can stand tall and not have to fold myself up into a tiny space– something I always do. I always feel like I&#8217;m &#8220;apologizing&#8221; for being tall and skinny, and I feel like if I had more meat on my bones, if I literally took up more mass as a human being, then I would be justified in taking up the space that my frame needs in order for me to feel comfortable. And I&#8217;d get rid of all my Medium sized t-shirts once and for all, and permanently be a Large, maybe even an XL some day. And I&#8217;d be happy and eager to buy me some proper shirts that fit.

B: It bothers you that you don&#8217;t fit in?

A: I&#8217;m happy to be a deviant person intellectually, even socially. But I don&#8217;t like it when I feel like my very proportions as a person are out of wack. I don&#8217;t like how it affects my social interactions. I don&#8217;t like being that oddly lanky guy, you know? A big guy is fine if he&#8217;s well proportioned. But the person who&#8217;s oddly lanky (or oddly short– I feel so bad for oddly short guys, because there&#8217;s really not very much they can do about it– and it seems like the solution for them is to get buff too, because everybody can respect a healthy amount of powerful muscle).

B: So you want to get fit so that people will like you more?

A: In a sense yes, but I think more fundamentally it&#8217;s so that I&#8217;ll be more comfortable in my skin around people. I don&#8217;t mind if people don&#8217;t like me, I just don&#8217;t want it to be because I look like an awkward gangly guy. If somebody says &#8220;Why are you so buff,&#8221; (what a fantasy), I can smile and shake it off easily. When they go &#8220;Eh, you&#8217;re very skinny&#8221;, I don&#8217;t know what to say.

B: That&#8217;s cute. You have body issues.

A: An unfortunate side effect of living in meatspace as a meatbag. See, if we all lived in a virtual reality this would be a non-issue.

B: I&#8217;m sure people are working on that.
