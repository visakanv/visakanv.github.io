I have a lot of thoughts and a lot of questions. My first question is to do with these vomits. Why am I writing these? It&#8217;s been a while. We&#8217;ve come some way. I started out in late 2012, and the calendar now says 2015. We&#8217;re almost 3 years into this, we&#8217;ve almost been doing this for 1000+ days. [1] It feels like now is a good time to pause and reflect. At 370+ vomits, I&#8217;m over 1/3 of the way there. We&#8217;ll be crossing the middle point soon. I&#8217;d like to cross it strongly. (But weakly will be better than not crossing it at all.)

I first started the word vomit project with the intention of writing a million words. There were a couple of central ideas to it– one was the 10,000 hours rule of deliberate practice. If I&#8217;m honest with myself, I know that I haven&#8217;t actually been all that deliberate. My vomits aren&#8217;t done in the optimal state of mind. So realistically, the word vomits project is actually the precursor to my actual 10,000 hours project. But it&#8217;s pretty clear that writing is going to be my life&#8217;s work. [2] But yeah, this hasn&#8217;t been as deliberate as I&#8217;d have liked. But that&#8217;s a useful piece of information. I&#8217;m learning something about myself, my abilities, my attitude, my standards.

The simpler idea was just this: That I&#8217;d be a different person at the end of writing 1,000,000 words. That I would have a completely different writing style, a completely different attitude and perspective towards words. A different relationship with words altogether. I had already witnessed how my writing had changed after writing a few hundred blogposts, and I wanted to really kick that into overdrive. How far can I build upon this? How much can I level up? I wanted to know.

Also, the project seemed novel and like it would give me some sort of legitimacy and street cred. Here things get a bit cloudy. I&#8217;m realizing now that the project isn&#8217;t as sexy as I thought it would be, and people aren&#8217;t nearly as interested in it as I hoped they would be. I stated to myself that I didn&#8217;t really care about anything other than my own relationships with my writing, but I&#8217;d be lying if I said there wasn&#8217;t a part of me that hoped I would somehow get catapulted into importance or significance. I suppose I vastly underestimated how that works, but that&#8217;s also another good lesson. To earn that sort of legitimacy, you have to consistently deliver really valuable stuff. I&#8217;ve written a few things that have taken off– my vomits about &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do well because I didn&#8217;t study&#8221;, my analysis of Mean Girls and my rant about productivity apps all were well-responded to. Yet even those successes– which thrilled me at the time when they were happening, because I was getting all this social validation– now somehow ring hollow. They aren&#8217;t particularly compelling, they aren&#8217;t particularly meaningful. They just entertained a bunch of people for some period of time. I look at Tim Urban&#8217;s work with Wait But Why and I realize that&#8217;s what I was hoping to do, but I was far from qualified or able at the time. And I&#8217;m not sure if I am now. I want to complete this project before I do anything else. So onwards with this. I&#8217;m sort of imposing an arbitrary, artificial constraint on myself because otherwise I wander aimlessly. And I want to train myself to commit, focus and complete the things that I set out to do, because I think that will serve me much better in the long run than short-term opportunism. It&#8217;s far less exhausting, too. I&#8217;ll be able to follow my own schedule rather than rushing and racing after whatever&#8217;s current. When everybody zigs, zag, init?

A couple of times I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve mentioned this feeling that I&#8217;m feeling now, which is that my writing leads me to a point that makes me realize that writing can be rather superfluous. What I need in my life is action more so than talk. I&#8217;ve rediscovered the writings of Aaron Swartz (and by extension, Ray Dalio) and find that they say almost everything I could possibly have hoped to want to say. And that should be a liberating thing, it should mean that I can move on to writing what&#8217;s next. (Granted, I really ought to read and internalize those things before anything else. But hey, this is a writing project and I have to keep writing no matter what. That&#8217;s just the deal right now.)

So what do I want now? I want to pay attention to how much I&#8217;ve changed, for one. I want to see if this project has been worthwhile so far. Well, has it? Before I even decide on that, I need to ask– why? I suppose it&#8217;s because I want to know if I should continue or &#8220;quit while I&#8217;m ahead&#8221;. But I don&#8217;t want to quit. Quitting is not an option here. I intend to see this through. So I suppose I want to know if I should continue &#8220;as-is&#8221;, or if I should make some changes to what I&#8217;m doing so that I can make better use of my time. So that this project grows in value to me. I don&#8217;t want it to be another 600,000+ words of me saying I wish I slept better, and I wish I did my work, and I wish this and I wish that. The time for wishing is long past. I have to confront my realities. So my writing has to reflect that. Contributing to this project is a privilege, and having the opportunity to say absolutely whatever I want is a privilege, too. I don&#8217;t want to waste that. I want to make the most of my time.

The project will continue. I will write a minimum of 1/day. And if I have more time after that, I&#8217;ll consider either writing more, or reading back to see what I&#8217;ve learned, and then refactor things. And I will do the work. I might be echoing myself but we&#8217;ll see at the end of it what has changed.

[1] Which means that I&#8217;ve been doing less than 1/day. What&#8217;s interesting is– I&#8217;ve been doing 1/day for the past week or so now, and it feels like I&#8217;m doing too little. But that&#8217;s actually more than I&#8217;ve been doing all along. It&#8217;s interesting to pay attention to this feeling. Because it means that my fundamental feeling for what progress looks like is actually really wrong. I know this intellectually, but it&#8217;s good to have an example to feel it with. Now I can return to this if I need to.

[2] I hope writing doesn&#8217;t die as a medium before I do. I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;ll stick around.
