TLDR:

  1. Wake up early every day (so sleep early too)
  2. Review work daily (with accountability partner)

So what&#8217;s my plan?

I value&#8230;

  * growth
  * progress
  * triumph over adversity
  * Confronting my fears and making them my bitch, and being better and stronger because of it

Alright. So what am I going to do to express those values? What is the plan of action?

**1. Wake up early every morning.** I&#8217;ve woken up at 6am the past 2 days. This by itself isn&#8217;t very remarkable, as it&#8217;s a habit that can slip at any time. But I&#8217;m making an extra effort not to let it slip. I&#8217;ve gotten my wife onboard on this, so we both wake up at 6am together. We set multiple alarms– both our phones, as well as her computer. There&#8217;s a cacophony of alarms at 6am in the morning. We&#8217;re going to do this for 49 days, including the weekend. The past couple of nights we actually slept pretty late, out of habit or self-sabotage or something. But we&#8217;ve been determined to stick to waking up, and so we did. The day before yesterday I went for a run after waking up.

Today I didn&#8217;t do very much when I woke– I was really groggy, but I got out of bed anyway and lay on the sofa for a while. I did leave for work earlier than I usually do. But I&#8217;m not going to be too harsh on myself for that. The plan is to make the habit of waking early stick. If there are some withdrawal symptoms or initial inefficiencies, I&#8217;ll bear with them. I know from long experience that whenever I wake up early, naturally and well rested, I feel really, really good. I make better decisions. I have space to plan out my day, to do things better. So I&#8217;m going to keep setting these alarms. We&#8217;re tracking our streak on a calendar taped to the wall, so it stares at us every morning when we wake up.

**2. Beyond that, I&#8217;m also committing to voluntarily sending my boss a daily email update of what I&#8217;ve done.** The idea is similar– it&#8217;s to create a structure that I need and want to commit to, so that things get done regularly. And it&#8217;s a really small quick update anyway. The process of doing it clarifies my thoughts about what I&#8217;m doing, and the PROSPECT of doing it makes me want to make sure that I have something worth reporting. So as a result I tend to subconciously pick my tasks better (as opposed to what I often used to do when I wasn&#8217;t accountable to anybody– I&#8217;d pick vague, open-ended tasks and spend the entire day exploring things without getting anything done).

In a sense, everything I&#8217;m trying to do is really just trying to unlearn the habit I have of spending large chunks of time doing random, undefined things. I suppose if I were really wealthy or something, I might be able to afford living that sort of life. But even then, I do it beyond my own inclinations. When I&#8217;m exploring, it&#8217;s not exactly mindful, conscientious exploring. And it doesn&#8217;t have as much flow as I wish it did– I don&#8217;t always feel flow doing this weird random open-ended wandering. I guess because flow needs some constraints. You need to be working within some boundaries, some restrictions before you can truly experience flow.

**I spend too much time completely unbounded, thinking that it&#8217;s freeing or liberating somehow, but it&#8217;s really not.** So that needs to change, for my own happiness&#8217;s sake, for my own growth and my own learning. It&#8217;s much more satisfying to leave the office having done 3 simple tasks than it is to have spend the day contemplating and exploring without getting anything substantial done.

So this experience is what I want to recreate day after day.

I want to leave work everyday feeling satisfied. I want to publish a word vomit before I go to bed, that leaves me satisfied too. And I want to wake early, and go for a run, and eat healthy, and all of these things are little baby steps in the direction of progress and growth. They free up more cognitive capacity. When I fulfill my obligations, they get out of my head and free up more space for play.

**It&#8217;s very difficult to truly enjoy play when you know that you owe people things.** It has to be a very escapist sort of play– you have to sorta drug yourself, distract yourself, zone out. And that&#8217;s only pleasant in the sense that the pain and fear and anguish is momentarily gone, hidden just out of sight. It&#8217;s like the pleasure you get when you take off your really tight shoes for a minute, before you put them back on again. And that is not a sustainable way to live. That is a really sad, unpleasant way to live.

**And I don&#8217;t want to hate on myself for that.** I don&#8217;t want to be cruel or unkind to myself for that. It&#8217;s unnecessary, and it&#8217;s also distracting. The real question is, what&#8217;s the desired end state? And what&#8217;s my plan of action to get to that desired end state? And what problems will I encounter along the way, and how do I visualize myself dealing with those problems, to make sure they don&#8217;t happen again? And then what steps do I need to take to make sure that goes according to plan? And when I&#8217;m done with that, what&#8217;s the next desired end state? This is a new language for me, but I intend to be fluent in it.

When I&#8217;m done with this, I&#8217;m going to hit publish. Then I&#8217;m going to hand the laptop to my wife, and I&#8217;m going to go ink in the two crosses for the two vomits I&#8217;d have published. Then I&#8217;m going to scratch out the day, the 8th day in a row that I&#8217;ve done a word vomit. (It&#8217;s also the 7th workday in a row that I emailed my boss as I had planned.) And then I&#8217;m going to go to bed, relaxed because I know I&#8217;ve pretty much done my best– or at least I&#8217;ve done better than I&#8217;ve done so far, and tomorrow I will wake up at 6am, cross out the &#8221; woke at 6am&#8221; box for the 3rd day running, and smile because I&#8217;m making progress.
