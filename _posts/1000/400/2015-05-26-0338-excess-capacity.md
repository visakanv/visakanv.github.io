It&#8217;s 943 and I&#8217;m out of the house, I&#8217;m on the way to work. I went to bed at midnight yesterday, and set an alarm for 630. I woke up, heard the alarm, switched it off. My dominant thought was- it&#8217;s really early, still dark, I&#8217;m really tired. I did notice that there was a quieter thought: that I ought to get out of bed immediately. But it was a rather weak thought at the time, and I hadn&#8217;t tied it to anything. The idea of another 1.5 hrs of sleep or so sounded really nice. And I fell back asleep before waking at around 8&#8230; and then I lingered in bed some more before getting out.

I feel like it&#8217;s really microscopic progress- or maybe it&#8217;s not progress at all, but it feels like a slightly better attempt, a slightly better failure. I&#8217;ll keep on this every day. Tomorrow when the alarm goes off, the plan will be to get up and immediately write a word vomit before I&#8217;m allowed to go back to bed. The idea being, hopefully, that once I&#8217;m done with a word vomit I should be much more awake and I could then choose to do something else. A run would be good if it&#8217;s still early and not yet hot outside. I believe that I can make progress on this, even if it&#8217;s been annoyingly slow.

It feels good to have done two word vomits yesterday even if they weren&#8217;t anything special.

I&#8217;m not sure if I wrote about this in one of the past vomits so I&#8217;ll write it again- I have been trying to improve my timing at my 2.4km run. The first 3 or 4 attempts I made were all terrible- I&#8217;d start too fast, and then I&#8217;d get tired midway and my legs or lungs would start to hurt and I would have to stop and walk for a while. So for my last attempt I decided to just maintain a slow jog the whole way- it was definitely a little too slow and my calves were aching like crazy (they&#8217;re sore right now as I write this)- but I completed the whole thing and shaved a minute off my time. It was a little victory that I have badly needed for quite some time now.

It&#8217;s very easy to overgeneralize things, but I think I&#8217;m already overgeneralizing some things and I could benefit from an overgeneralization in a different direction. I can correct the little nuances later.

I want to explore the beliefs that I must be holding without having explicitly stated them- the beliefs that can only be inferred.

1: If it&#8217;s painful or difficult I should do it later. I will be able to do it better later.

2: I am capable of pushing myself really, really hard and getting things done at the last minute, and I enjoy this.

3: I can squeeze in a little bit of distraction into my work, while I&#8217;m working.

4: I can multitask.

5: I don&#8217;t need to bother planning or prioritising- things typically take care of themselves sooner or later.

6: I don&#8217;t like doing difficult things. I want an easy life.

7: I don&#8217;t care about my health, nothing will happen to me and it&#8217;s okay to have a foggy brain from poor meatbag management.

8: I don&#8217;t need to plan intermediate steps- I can figure things out as I go.

9: My environment doesn&#8217;t have much of an effect on my output. I can work with tabs open.

10: I have all the time in the world.

At this point I had a meeting/chat with a mentor and it was quite cathartic. Helped me resolve a bunch of pains that I&#8217;ve been having inside my head. I talked about how I&#8217;ve been wanting to take a vacation or quit or something, just to run away from my circumstances, and we explored how the thing that annoys me about my circumstances is my constant catch-up. I&#8217;m always behind, I never have excess capacity to focus my attention and energy towards the things that I want to achieve.

And this constant stucked-ness that I&#8217;m in has been wearing me down. I haven&#8217;t been growing lately. I have been dragging my feet through my days and then wondering why I never seem to go anywhere, never seem to able to get on the rides that I want to get on. And while it&#8217;s totally possible for me to just stop and drop everything, sooner or later I&#8217;m going to want to do something else, and again I&#8217;m going to be stuck where I am because I don&#8217;t have this ability to direct my resources effectively. And so I struggle to be accountable to others. I struggle to be accountable to myself. I struggle to get things done, and that state of being drives me nuts because I know there&#8217;s so much more to life, there&#8217;s so much more that I could be experiencing and learning and growing and doing if I just&#8230; fulfill my responsibilities.

So what&#8217;s stopping me? I think I&#8217;ve been stuck in a run-out-the-clock Loser (Gervais Principle) mindset. The real problem I need to solve is getting more excess capacity each day. That would give me the single most powerful thing I could have, to do everything else that I want to do. Time. Headspace. These are precious resources that I squander everyday.

What is stopping me from getting excess capacity, apart from habit? What&#8217;s the path from current status to excess capacity? I don&#8217;t want to badly enough, I don&#8217;t make it a priority. Why? Well&#8230; I&#8217;ve simply never lived like this, and I guess it&#8217;s scary. In the middle of my days I yearn for comfort and familiarity. In the middle of moments I stretch things out, languish and linger. We go back to me being a lingerer. I linger because I don&#8217;t know where I should go. But that&#8217;s the old me. I&#8217;ve been here for a couple of years now and I know that while there&#8217;s an infinite number of things to do, there&#8217;s a finite number of things to do each day and I need to own that, and see how owning that will bring me joy the way I get joy after completing a vomit or completing a run.

So there, then. I should enjoy my time at work, because I finish stuff. The way I finish writing and the way I finish working out. That&#8217;s as simple as that. I owe myself pleasure and joy and happiness and all that good stuff. And then I can help other people, too. It&#8217;s an insane win-win-win and I&#8217;m not doing it yet because maybe I don&#8217;t frame it properly. Well we&#8217;ll frame it as clearly and concretely as possible now, and we&#8217;ll see what else is missing from the picture.
