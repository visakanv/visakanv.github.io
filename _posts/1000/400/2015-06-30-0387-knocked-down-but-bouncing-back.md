I fell sick again. I fell pretty hard, too. It coincided with me pretty much overtraining for my fitness tests, and my arms were so sore yesterday and the day before that I had to ask my wife to help me towel off after I showered, and to dry my hair, and to put on my t-shirt. Which was pretty embarassing. I lost my appetite completely, and subsisted entirely on 100 plus and packets of milo. I lay in bed for hours tossing and turning. It&#8217;s been really nasty. I feel like I&#8217;m past the worst of it, but I can&#8217;t be too careful with this.

So already I&#8217;ve fallen off the wagon of doing at least one word vomit a day. I didn&#8217;t get any work done on Friday, though I managed to send my daily update email as promised, somehow, through the delirium. Thankfully I had planned to finish my week&#8217;s work by Thursday, so all that didn&#8217;t get done was &#8220;extra&#8221; stuff.

I&#8217;m re-reading a bunch of old vomits and juxtaposing that against some chats with a friend who seems to be going through what I went through. And I was saying things like, &#8220;All that&#8217;s holding me back is a lack of discipline, structure, routine.&#8221;

_(here I left for lunch, came back home, got tired and decided to rest instead, and rested for days without writing)_

And you know, those things are valid, but not necessarily the right lens through which to view things, within the context of &#8220;I want to fix things and get better.&#8221; It&#8217;s possible to say valid-things all day and yet not go anywhere. (See _again_: &#8220;[I didn&#8217;t do well because I didn&#8217;t study](http://visakanv.com/1000/0049-i-didnt-do-well-because-i-didnt-study/).&#8221;) I realized this mainly when I was listening to my friend repeat those things to me (via IM) with a sort of deadness in his tone and a general sort of &#8220;I-don&#8217;t-really-know, I&#8217;m-just-saying-what-I-think-I&#8217;m-supposed-to-say&#8221;. And I realize&#8230; you do need to have something that you&#8217;re working TOWARDS. The discipline, structure and routine do not exist because they do not have a compelling enough reason to exist.

So what do I want? I must&#8217;ve written about a dozen &#8220;what I want&#8221; posts by now, some of them written in moments of passionate earnest, others written in sort of depressed, dejected frustration. Well. In this case I think repetition is key. I want to destroy the old me that was pained, frustrated, anxious, weary. I no longer want to even bother trying to &#8220;do justice&#8221; to him. The old-me was haphazardly, randomly constructed, a mess of inherited neuroses and all sorts of annoying issues. I realize that I use Trello for work quite regularly, and so I&#8217;ve created a personal Trello board for myself where I list out all the things that I know to be true. I list out a bunch of things that I hate. I hate being sick. I hate being weak. I hate being unreliable. I hate being wasteful. I hate being unfair and unkind– to others and myself. I hate being unfocused. I hate being unprepared. I hate feeling like I&#8217;ve reached some sort of peak or plateau, that I&#8217;m done learning most of what I&#8217;m ever going to learn. That&#8217;s bullshit. I&#8217;ve definitely learned less than 20% of everything I&#8217;m ever going to learn. In fact, considering the world we live in, I&#8217;ve probably learned less than 5% of everything I&#8217;m ever going to learn. Probably 1% of everything I could possibly learn.

And the thing is, all sorts of book knowledge right now doesn&#8217;t help me go anywhere. I asked a few friends to school me about the Greek situation, just so I have a semi-informed POV. But I have no interest in developed a much more accurate POV because there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it. I&#8217;m not going to save Greece. Hell, over the past year it feels like I can barely save myself. I need saving. And I need to save myself, because nobody else is going to do it for me.

What is this saving&#8230;? I feel like I might have written recently (or thought about writing) about the idea that &#8220;someday my prince will surely come&#8221;. Someday my life will work out beautifully. I still do believe that, fundamentally. I believe it because there are too many times where I find myself thinking that I&#8217;m perceiving something other people aren&#8217;t. But these perceptions are currently a source of distraction and misery. They&#8217;re worthless as long as I can&#8217;t do anything about them. And my ability to do things is a whole other animal. My ability to execute.

It feels like I fell sick, as I often do, because of bad management. I am a terrible CEO of Visakan, Inc. I spend most of the time waffling off avoiding anything of importance because I&#8217;m afraid of smearing my &#8216;perfect&#8217; perceptions and ideals and imagination with imperfect words and deeds and doings. But hey, fuck it. Imperfect is the only way forward. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve written that before, but I&#8217;ll write it again as many times as I have to so that this stuff really gets ingrained into my mind and the way my brain works. I didn&#8217;t do word vomits for a few days while I was sick. So be it. I&#8217;m coming right back, and I&#8217;ll be better and stronger because of it. There is no turning back. I want to grow up. I want to be an adult. I don&#8217;t want to have to explain to people why I couldn&#8217;t do something or why I failed. I never want to do that ever again. I want to instead be explaining the actions I&#8217;ve taken, and the plans I have for further actions to be taken. If I&#8217;m 1% as great as my subconscious thinks I am, we&#8217;ll be achieving amazing things. The thing is that my action muscle is maybe 1% as strong as it needs to be. But that&#8217;s no matter. That&#8217;s just a matter of training, discipline, structure, routine, habit. And all I need for that is to do something again and again, every day, and then to add things to it. To add reflections. To add plans. I have my daily vomits. I fell down but I am back up. I will work hard and I will keep going. For a future that is full of difficult challenges. That will be the pleasurable sort of pain, like the warm soreness you get when you&#8217;ve been working out for a while– not the horrific ache of helplessness.

That&#8217;s what I want. I want to be strong. I want to be able to cut through the bullshit that life throws at me with sharp cuts. And when I&#8217;m done with my personal obligations– and I WILL get on top of them– I will help others do the same. And in the spaces we carve out for ourselves, we will rest peacefully, under the protection of each other&#8217;s watchful eyes.
