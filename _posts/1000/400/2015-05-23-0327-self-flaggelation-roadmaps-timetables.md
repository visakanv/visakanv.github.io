I am a self-flagellator. It&#8217;s a weird thing to realize, because for most of my life I thought I couldn&#8217;t care less. I thought I didn&#8217;t care about outcomes, I didn&#8217;t care about process, I was just this lackadaisical happy-go-lucky dude who&#8217;d just go with the flow, have fun, not take things so seriously, not worry so much. After all, I was&#8217;t doing my homework, I wasn&#8217;t keeping my appointments, I was a generally irresponsible person. And I still sort of am. I&#8217;ve made some progress but it&#8217;s nothing to write home about (am I being harsh on myself there? I don&#8217;t know.)

But over the past couple of years I&#8217;ve come to realize that I have this cycle of&#8230; being incompetent and then beating myself up for it, and then being incompetent again. There&#8217;s a cycle. I&#8217;ve written about a part of myself as a saboteur-bum before, and I think that&#8217;s still not the full picture. The saboteur is responding and reacting to the self-flaggelator. There&#8217;s some sort of twisted punisher or disciplinarian in my head who isn&#8217;t interested in solving problems. He&#8217;s only interested in reminding me that I&#8217;m incompetent, that I&#8217;m failing, that I&#8217;m screwing up. And that&#8217;s the guy I&#8217;m often trying to run away from. That seems to be why I end up opening a ton of tabs and wasting time on Facebook or arguing with people on the internet and things like that. The self-flagellator is the ignorant, abusive parent inside my head who isn&#8217;t interested in understanding why the child is recalcitrant– he just sees something to be punished.

I suppose I probably inherited this from other people, without even realizing it. Maybe a little bit from family, a little bit from tired, exhausted teachers and peers, and a little bit from just watching how people treat other people. It&#8217;s just an unquestioned assumption about how the world works. I preemptively yell at myself inside my head (wordlessly!) so that when people DO inevitably yell at me, it&#8217;s something I saw coming. It doesn&#8217;t take me by surprise. It&#8217;s to be expected, it&#8217;s the natural order of things. I am a person who gets yelled at because I am irresponsible and incompetent and screw things up and can&#8217;t pay attention and can&#8217;t focus on anything. I am a child. At the heart of it all I am a child who hasn&#8217;t learned to grow up. Even with the marriage and the mortgage and bills to pay and a job to do. I suppose it&#8217;s better I figure this out now at 25 rather than say, at 40. That would be pretty painful. And I imagine lots of people struggle with this. 

Well, so what&#8217;s next? When I meditate, when I&#8217;m calm, when I&#8217;m relaxed, I realize that self-flaggelation doesn&#8217;t help. In fact I think the biggest learning for me is just observing how my boss treats me when I screw up. He doesn&#8217;t yell. He patiently asks questions while I get impatient with myself in his presence. I feel like an idiot without him telling me I&#8217;m an idiot. He just asks questions, beyond what I would ask myself. He wants to know the reasons, he wants to know what&#8217;s stopping me, and he wants to know it with genuine curiosity and empathy. And I realize, when I have no answer for him, that he has more curiosity and empathy towards me than I have towards myself. He&#8217;s more curious about how I tick than I might be. (Well– to qualify that, I claim to be more curious, maybe, but I seem to be running in circles around my comfort zone, while he asks questions that pull me out of it.) 

When I ask myself questions about things like &#8220;Why did I not sleep late at night?&#8221; the answer the self-flaggelator gives (or the child gives the self-flaggelator) is &#8220;because I&#8217;m an irresponsible fuck&#8221;. But that&#8217;s apparently not satisfactory as an answer, and I see how it is. It&#8217;s not a cause-and-effect explanation, it&#8217;s a label. It&#8217;s like saying &#8220;he&#8217;s doing badly in school because he&#8217;s black.&#8221; That sounds like a horrible thing to say about somebody else, so how can we say such things about ourselves?

I suppose this is where genuinely radical self-love comes in– radical not in doing extreme things, radical not in grand gestures or proclamations– radical in a simple question, radical in a simple act of defiance against conventional wisdom. 

So why, Visa? Why are you stuck where you are? If you can&#8217;t yet recognize that you&#8217;re not, what is this illusion that you&#8217;re clinging on to, so hard, for dear life? 

I can&#8217;t seem to think my way out of this one, at least not yet. I find myself returning to answers from the past, from my childhood. Oh, my parents were a certain way, my upbringing was a certain way, it&#8217;s inherited habits, it takes a long time to fix, etc. Sure. But if I now recognize that I was in a bad place, and I want to go to a good place, what&#8217;s stopping me from going to the good place?

Well let&#8217;s break it down. First you need to know where you are. Then you need to know where you&#8217;re going. Then you need to know what&#8217;s the path from where you are to where you&#8217;re going. Then you need to know what steps you need to take to make progress along the path.

I suppose the problem is that&#8230; in moments of reflection, these things seem clear, but in the fog of day-to-day life, these things become much less clear. And in the darkness I get scared and cling to old things that are familiar. I fail to follow the plan because I don&#8217;t recognize the plan in the dark, and I start doubting myself, start thinking maybe I&#8217;m not ready, maybe I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing.

So at least a part of the solution is to really make these plans clearer. What&#8217;s my main thing right now? I don&#8217;t actually know. I haven&#8217;t actually written it down. And as long as that thing isn&#8217;t in stone, I&#8217;m going to default to what IS in stone– which is whatever old habits I was familiar with.

So the problem is that I haven&#8217;t got a clear roadmap that&#8217;s tattooed into my brain, onto my skin. I quickly forget, in the heat of the moment, what I want, what I&#8217;m working towards, what I&#8217;m going for. And the self-flaggelation happens afterwards, when I&#8217;m confronted and I need to justify why I was screwing up. It&#8217;s easier to say &#8220;I&#8217;m a fuck&#8221; than to say &#8220;I didn&#8217;t hold on to my goals and plans&#8221;. The real solution should be to handcuff myself to my plans, at least for a few months or so. And I suppose I&#8217;m afraid of doing that. I always find some way to weasel out of that.

But weaseling is not a long-term solution. The handcuffs lead me to freedom. This is what my parents and teachers tried to get me to see when I was a kid. Timetables aren&#8217;t meant to restrict you. They&#8217;re meant to free you. I need to see this.
