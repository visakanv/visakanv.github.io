Over and over again I think it&#8217;s a good idea to revisit everything from first principles. Start from what you know is true.

What do I know is true? I like writing. I like learning. I want to get stronger. I want to help people. I want to be not-a-burden. I want to be ahead of other people– partially because being better is nice, but also mostly because I think I&#8217;m good at being kind to people, better than most people might be at being kind to people who are failing or screwing up– probably just because I know what it&#8217;s like to be a screwup of some sort.

I also recognize that I&#8217;m not &#8220;deeply satisfied&#8221; with who I am and where I am, and while I think a part of that solution requires meditative mindfulness and practicing gratitude and all that, another part of it is taking the right actions. And I don&#8217;t take the right actions enough. And it&#8217;s not like I don&#8217;t know what the right actions are, is it? The actions are there, just that there&#8217;s friction between knowing the action and taking the action. The flinch. So I need to practice taking actions, that&#8217;s it. Like cleaning the fridge or vacuuming the aircon filters. Chores.

I know that if I stay where I am, there will be some conflict down the line where I get frustrated with myself. Earlier I talked about time-blindness– this mostly tends to apply on a minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour sort of perspective. If I take a longer view– 5 years or longer, I recognize that I will be frustrated. So I need to accelerate getting to the frustration point. I need to empathize with myself and feel the frustration now so I can do something about it.

There were many horrible times when I was in JC or NS or something and I hoped and hoped that someday something would recognize that I have value. To walk away from it because it&#8217;s challenging would be tragic. If I did do that, if I did give up on all this, I would have to explain to myself why that is. And that would be a crappy thing to have to explain to myself. I would have to construct a very large and complicated ediface just to say &#8220;I was scared. I didn&#8217;t believe in myself. I didn&#8217;t think I could do it. I was afraid of failure. I was afraid of looking stupid.&#8221;

And you know what, fuck it! It doesn&#8217;t matter if I can&#8217;t do it, I want to try anyway. It doesn&#8217;t matter if I look stupid. So what if I look stupid? Why don&#8217;t we get that out of the way and assume that everybody in the Universe thinks I&#8217;m stupid? There are many people who go through their lives quite happily despite being thought of as idiots. Why should that bother me? This is me holding on to a very outdated and obsolete way of measuring my own value. I should value myself for trying, not for being right. Fuck being right. Just be wrong in the right direction. Just collect data points. Just do things again and again.

If I&#8217;m honest about solving problems I&#8217;ll stop describing the situation at some point and focus on the output that needs to happen.  Its hould e troubling when a description of a problem gets too elaborate. I need to internalize this. I can&#8217;t just recognize it as correct, the way I used to recognize things as valid when I was in maths lectures. &#8220;Yeah, that makes sense&#8221; – but so what? I wasn&#8217;t really doing anything about it!

I need to have a day-to-day chain going that I can point at and go &#8220;i can trust this&#8221;. Describing the problem != solving the problem.
  
It&#8217;s poisonous and dangerous when I sit around describing problems and I feel like I&#8217;m making some sort of progress. Block out / delete descriptions, present only evidence of progress or work done.

Describing a problem is useful only in a specific context– when it&#8217;s \*strictly\* about making the problem more precise towards the end of finding a solution and making the solution more precise. If I&#8217;m hungry, I need to eat to stop being hungry, I need to figure out how and where to get food, and I need to eat.

If I&#8217;m hungry, then wonder what my brain chemistry is like when I&#8217;m hungry, then think about how to study or measure brain chemistry, then I&#8217;m not actually solving my hunger problem.

Alternatively, if I make the problem more precise than it needs to be– for example, thinking about what sort of shoes I ought to wear to optimize the walking I need to do to get to the sandwich shop where I&#8217;m going to be eating, and then how I ought to tie my laces. Thinking about those details is a distraction, and takes up time and resources. I might think about that stuff while I&#8217;m eating or after eating, but not before. The important thing to do when you need to eat&#8230; is eat.

I also need to very tightly constrain my definition of &#8220;outline problem + identify possible actions&#8221;, becaus that&#8217;s very vague and I&#8217;m addicted to just talking about problems all day instead of working towards specific solutions and executing those solutions.
