Every so often it helps to start from scratch. What do I really want to be doing? What am I really all about? What should I be doing with my limited resources?

I know that I want to write, and that I want to get better at writing. That&#8217;s a good node to have at the heart of my system. I will always want to write, and always want to get better at writing. This might be a way of saying that I want to get better at thinking and communicating, clearly and effectively. It could be that I someday want to express myself through movies, through visuals, through diagrams and such. That&#8217;s fine, I think that&#8217;s just a subset of the fact that I&#8217;m very interested expression, and that I associate pleasure and quality of life with effective expression.

But okay, so expression is just half the equation. What am I supposed to be expressing? What do I want to talk about? The first thing that enters my head is &#8220;everything and nothing&#8221;, which is a cute answer but not very useful. Let&#8217;s make it smaller. I want to be at least a little bit practical. I&#8217;m idealistic, but I don&#8217;t want to be tilting at windmills and writing inspirational-sounding things that aren&#8217;t grounded in reality, that aren&#8217;t useful for me or others in living life better.

What does it mean to live life well? It means to sleep well at night, really. To laugh a lot. To smile. To learn. To grow. To be able to do more, make more of a difference, manipulate reality better. A couple of vomits ago I was feeling a little stuck thinking about writing processes. I&#8217;ll be very satisfied to one day be able to crack that open and run through it smoothly and skillfully. If I can repeatedly do that for the rest of my life I think I will be very satisfied indeed. That would&#8217;ve been a facet of a good life.

What are the other facets of a good life? Service to others. How can I serve others? It starts with serving myself, and serving myself so well that it spills out onto others, that it gives others permission to do the same. Okay, how can I serve myself? One thing I can do is to stop writing and start working on other things, but for the time being I&#8217;m suspending that to focus on thinking further, writing more. Collect before you select. I went to the gym yesterday and I&#8217;m feeling really good about that. I&#8217;ve had 3 workouts so far. It will be interesting to see what I&#8217;m like at 10 workouts, 30, 100, 300. I will be a different person. I&#8217;ve already started, and I&#8217;m just going to keep going.

Okay, but where does writing factor into all of that? It got me here, but what next? I guess I like the idea of keeping track of progress, but you need to make progress before you can keep track.

We&#8217;re meandering. Let&#8217;s move to another point. How can I serve myself? I need to identify my own weaknesses and break through them. Earlier I realized that I was feeling sleepy and tired, and decided to experiment by writing through it. And I have written through it, and some of it was ugly and messy, but I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m still going. And now I feel a bit of a sense of flow, and I&#8217;m going to keep going. I&#8217;d like to hit 320 today so that I can sleep great at night. Once I hit 320 I&#8217;m going to do other kinds of work, and then we&#8217;ll go for 340 another time. It&#8217;s all arbitrary, it&#8217;s all made up, but as long as I&#8217;m moving and I&#8217;m having fun, none of it matters. As long as it meets my own standards, it&#8217;s not cheating. This is what I wanted to capture, and I&#8217;m capturing it.

I suppose a huge part of all of this is me managing my own mental state, my own psychology. These words are just symbols, signifiers, signposts. What I&#8217;m really trying to do is to rewire my brain in a way that I feel is good for me. Cigarettes used to be a big part of my life, and I weeded that out. I have books that I want to read. I have habits that I want to form. What book do I most want to read next? It&#8217;s interesting that I don&#8217;t seem to have a short answer to that. I have about 4-5 books that I&#8217;m reading at the same time right now– The Box, A Sideways Look At Time, The Game, First Break All The Rules, The News&#8230; is there any particular reason why I&#8217;m reading any of them? Not really. Should I pick any single one of them to finish right now? I&#8217;m not really feeling that right now, but I think I might go through First Break All The Rules. The more I keep writing this, the more it&#8217;s going to become clearer that I should switch to doing the work that I&#8217;m hired to do. So we&#8217;ll get there. What shall we do until we get there?

I suppose it&#8217;s interesting enough that I sit and play with my thoughts and my words instead of procrastinating on Reddit or Imgur or other forms of cheap internet content consumption. I would like to ideally be free of that someday, to not really even feel the need to check it out– just as I have greatly diminished my need to have cigarettes be a part of my life.

Eergh. Feels like I&#8217;m just going through the motions saying things that I say over and over again. Would like to question some of these things and unpackage them and go somewhere new with them. I think for my next vomit I&#8217;ll go back to dialoguing with these characters I&#8217;ve been sorta-inventing inside my head, and we&#8217;ll see what happens there. Or maybe not.

It&#8217;s a little sad and amusing that, given the chance to do absolutely anything, we tend to fall into doing what we&#8217;ve always done– probably because it&#8217;s cheap, simple, easy, familiar.
