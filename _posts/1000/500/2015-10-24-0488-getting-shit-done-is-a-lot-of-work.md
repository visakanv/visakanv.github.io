So this is interesting. It&#8217;s 12 noon now. I was able to chug from 5am till about 730am, then I got tired and started reading nonsense. Next thing I knew it was 9am. Did a bit more writing&#8230; then it was 1030am. My wife woke up, we hung out for a while, I did some reading (TechGnosis). Then I just sort of wandered around the house for a while. I should probably eat and take a nap. I&#8217;ll do one more vomit and then go down for brunch. I should&#8217;ve eaten earlier, I guess. But so far doing quite alright for a Saturday morning, I feel.

After writing a vomit about boredom and cluttered minds, I went to glance at my bookshelves and I realized that&#8230; there isn&#8217;t really a lot of stuff I want to read. At least, that was the thought I had. And the corrective thought that followed was– well, I need to figure out what my reading priorities are. What do I want to read? What are my purposes? There are several threads to follow. One is the whole pagan wisdom thing– Gabrielle Roth&#8217;s Connections, Jay Griffiths&#8217; Sideways Look At Time, and now TechGnosis. I&#8217;d like a bit more of that, but I&#8217;m a bit tired of that right now. What else? I&#8217;d like to revisit the Edge books (where they ask smart people a single question, and then collect all the answers). I feel like I&#8217;d like to re-read Carl Sagan&#8217;s biography, and User Illusion, but do I really&#8230;? Hah, I shouldn&#8217;t overthink my feelings. I should just do what I want. And I suppose right now I don&#8217;t actually feel like reading. I have a couple of history books on my Kindle that I&#8217;m reading. I&#8217;d still like to develop a better understanding of nutrition, ATP, sleep, low blood sugar, etc&#8230; and that might be something better done online? I&#8217;ll extract what I can from the books I have– the Energy Of Life is one such book that I have. Okay, so I&#8217;m overthinking my reading. I have 4-5 books in line, and I can make notes. Cool.

What else is up? I&#8217;ve been wanting to clean out my Workflowy, which has gotten rather cluttered. As I scan through it, I see a lot of stuff that &#8220;might be useful&#8221;, but it&#8217;s really just taking up space. What should I do with it? I can save the file and upload it to the cloud and then not look at it. There&#8217;s a part of me that just wants everything to be tidy, but is that a sort of compulsive busyness activity? Let&#8217;s pop over to the Workflowy again.

Ah yeah, I&#8217;d like to read some old wisdom. Seneca, Montaigne. And I&#8217;d like to re-read Paul Graham&#8217;s essays, maybe. And once I&#8217;ve bounded my word vomits that I&#8217;ve printed out, I&#8217;d like to re-read those. I think re-reading old vomits is probably the best reading choice out of all my options, because I feel like there&#8217;s some unresolved stuff from the older vomits that I ought to readdress ASAP.

I&#8217;ve made a bit more progress on my Workflowy. I realized I had a bullet for &#8220;Projects&#8221; and another bullet for &#8220;Brain Dump&#8221;, but a lot of the brain dump things were actually projects– so I&#8217;ve merged the two. I&#8217;ll eliminate the shittier projects altogether, and I&#8217;ll just dump anything that&#8217;s &#8220;brain dumpy&#8221; at the top or bottom of my workflowy and triage them into wherever they got to go. That feels better.

I also had another tab for &#8220;priorities&#8221;, I&#8217;m merging that into &#8220;projects&#8221; as well. Wow, that feels much better. Way too many folders.

Now I started looking into my &#8220;Work&#8221; tab, and hoo boy, there&#8217;s tonnes of mess there. All of this mess must be contributing to my general stress levels. I know I have all my stuff in places, but it&#8217;s not ordered neatly, it&#8217;s not easily accessible, there&#8217;s a lot of repetition and mess. Once I finish this vomit and go down for lunch, I should come back up and sort the crap out of my Workflowy so that I&#8217;m clearheaded again. No wonder I&#8217;m dazed and confused.

I suppose this vomit was just all about me trying to clarify what I want to do. At the end of the whole project, there are going to be quite a few vomits that were like this. And I think that&#8217;s a good thing. I was reading a post about managing your own psychology and it talked about how you ought to have &#8220;Start&#8221;, &#8220;Keep Doing&#8221;, &#8220;Stop&#8221; and so on. And you have to figure out what the best, worst and probable outcomes are, and assign probabilities&#8230;

Phew. Getting shit done is a lot of work. I suppose that&#8217;s why you should always go back to the source and remind yourself what you&#8217;re trying to achieve, who you want to be, what you&#8217;re trying to embody, what you&#8217;re doing all of this for. I&#8217;m writing these vomits to build discipline, to gain mastery of language, and to become a better thinker. I&#8217;m writing with the intent of influencing my actions and my behaviors, and I think so far it&#8217;s helping quite alright.

It&#8217;s nice to know that the present muddiness of my mind is a function of context and environment and state. Early this morning my brain was swimming in thoughts, and I put out 8,000 words of them down. And of course, they&#8217;re not going to do justice to the thoughts, but they never are. The point is to just keep putting them down and keep going. I&#8217;ll go have lunch with my wife, and it&#8217;ll feel good because I did get quite a big chunk of stuff done in a single morning. And then I&#8217;ll meditate and rest and see what my brain surprises me with next, as it inevitably will.

I realize– whenever I have a few words left, I used to write a bunch of gibberish to try and fill up my quota. Instead, I think I should write a note to my future self. Dear future Visa: I really want us to do well. I believe we can do it. I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t do better earlier, but I&#8217;m trying.
