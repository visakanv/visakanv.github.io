I was amused by a minor struggle I had this morning when choosing a toilet read. I&#8217;ve gone through quite a few books in there. Steve Wozniak&#8217;s autobiography was a great toilet read. So was Tolle&#8217;s Power of Now. So was Neil Strauss&#8217;s The Game. All of those were books that I was very happy to read. I had a couple of missteps, too. I got started on Osho&#8217;s Conversations With Remarkable People but I found it overly bullshitty for my taste. I tried reading The Box but it was too information-dense. I tried re-reading 48 Laws of Power but somehow it just feels like a bit of a slog. I started on Brave New World, and it feels like something I want to read– but I&#8217;d like to promote that to &#8220;pressing read&#8221; rather than &#8220;toilet read&#8221;– pressing read meaning something I keep with me, read for hours at a time. So my Toilet Read slot is currently still vacant. I think I might try eBoys next. I don&#8217;t know.

I took a break at this point to tidy up my Workflowy a little. Which turned out to be a remarkably byzantine process, involving me opening many links and tumbling down multiple epic rabbitholes. But on hindsight that shouldn&#8217;t be surprising at all, that was what was keeping me from doing very much about it. The fact that it was sprawling. 

Which is actually what I want to think and write about. The whole sense of &#8220;I&#8217;ve got tonnes of stuff and nothing to do&#8221;. It doesn&#8217;t make sense, it&#8217;s a sort of illusion. It&#8217;s not a valid feeling, even though it feels real. Information overload. Too many things to do, a sense of too many possibilities. But it doesn&#8217;t feel like that&#8217;s all there is to it. To get the full picture we have to bring in the fact that some things are kept from the immediate consciousness, probably because they&#8217;re difficult and uncomfortable to deal with. Ugh fields. I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s the right lens to view this through.[1]

I keep saying to myself that I need to take many more breaks. But what should these breaks look like, and why am I not taking them already? Is it because I&#8217;m not measuring and paying attention to my time? I&#8217;ve experimented with so many different solutions already that I&#8217;ve gotten a bit weary of them all. It feels like there should be a simpler way, that I shouldn&#8217;t be using so many tools. Sure, I know that I need prosthetics, so I can&#8217;t just dive in solo– but drowning in a list of options is another form of paralysis.

Haven&#8217;t yet talked about what I wanted to talk about, which is how the feeling of &#8220;man, there&#8217;s nothing to do&#8221; is really deceptive. There&#8217;s never nothing to do. There&#8217;s always a list of interesting things to do, but interesting things can be a little hard, a litlte challenging, require some contextualizing, some effort. This requires some clarity of mind, some planning. So whenever it seems like there&#8217;s nothing to do, a person ought to shower, meditate and reflect for a while, and it&#8217;ll be pretty clear what needs to be done.

Got lost again. Came back here again. Each time these things happen a bunch of time passes. This happened entirely with me still sitting here, my bladder slowly filling, the clock moving forward, me recognizing that it&#8217;s getting later and later&#8230; me listening to something that I can&#8217;t actually focus on right now&#8230; so let me shut that off.

The most important thing in my life really seems to be about meditating and getting centered more regularly. Now I&#8217;ll open a tab and check Facebook real quick, and challenge myself to do it in under a minute or two. Why? Beats me. This is how my mind works when it&#8217;s late and I&#8217;m tired. Back here. About 6 minutes passed.

Am I making progress? I feel like I must be. I&#8217;m being more productive at work. I&#8217;ve been publishing these vomits more regularly than before. So it&#8217;s interesting to pay attention to this. It&#8217;s possible to make progress and yet feel like you&#8217;re not, really. Because you&#8217;re mindful of all the ways things are going wrong, even as things are going more right than before. It&#8217;s a conscious incompetence over unconscious incompetence thing. 

What now? I guess I&#8217;m just going to reaffirm that I want to read the books, and I want to tidy up the byzantine messes in my life. I know that it&#8217;ll never be 100% possible, but I do believe it&#8217;s possible to make 20% progress, 40%, 60%, 80%. And well&#8230; I don&#8217;t need to go that far. I just need to make one step forward a day. 1%. 0.1%. Whatever. I just need to keep moving. And as long as I keep moving and make a little progress everyday I think I&#8217;m doing okay. We can go to the next level when we&#8217;re ready.

[1] Here I find myself thinking, that&#8217;s one thing that meditation helps with. I saw a quote somewhere on Reddit that resonated with me. Someone asked, can&#8217;t meditation be a form of procrastination? And the reply was- procrastination is about avoiding something. Meditation is about non-avoidance. It&#8217;s about allowing whatever you&#8217;re avoiding to come into your presence. Sure, meditation is probably a lot more than just that, but that&#8217;s something useful, I think, from the perspective of procrastinators or anybody who feels strangely unsettled like I tend to do. Like there&#8217;s this odd sense of calm that isn&#8217;t real calm. Real calm acknowledges reality. The odd calm I often experience is a sort of escapist calm, artificially created by a mind that&#8217;s trying to protect itself from reality. But the truth is that hiding from reality is not a sustainable solution. And it&#8217;s not what I want to be doing. But my body and mind has had loads of practice doing this sort of denial over the years. So I need daily practices to help me reverse the habit. My daily writing practice is part of it. Daily work emails is part of it.
