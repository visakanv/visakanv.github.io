I wasn&#8217;t satisfied with the last vomit and I&#8217;d like to think about why that is the case.

I think it&#8217;s because I spent a lot of time trying to describe my starting conditions. I think I should attempt instead to summarize my starting conditions as succinctly as possible.

In the context of word vomits, it&#8217;s very tempting and easy to keep rambling on describing starting conditions. They&#8217;re already internalized, and I just need to talk about them. So I go on and on for as long as I can, and hope that something useful will come out of it. This is a valid strategy for approaching word vomits, but one that I&#8217;m getting a little bit tired of. So I&#8217;d like to think about what I&#8217;d prefer to do.

What happens after quickly summarizing starting conditions? Let&#8217;s take that last vomit. How would I summarize it? &#8220;I grew up thinking concepts like &#8220;integrity&#8221; were lame, and sort-of rebelled against them. It wasn&#8217;t very useful or effective towards any end. I&#8217;m starting to realize now that integrity is actually really useful, because it allows for efficiency. If you can trust a tool, you can focus on the task at hand. Not having integrity means not exactly being able to trust yourself.&#8221;

There we go. The above paragraph is the entire previous vomit, distilled.

Where would I have gone from there? I&#8217;d have asked myself, well, what&#8217;s interesting? What are the interesting questions that I should be asking?

How do I improve my own integrity? How do I get better at doing what I say I&#8217;ll do? How do I reduce the amount of time I waste running over the same old ground, over and over again?

Those are questions I don&#8217;t have immediate answers to [1], so addressing them is probably a good idea.

How do I get better at doing what I say I&#8217;ll do? There are a bunch of first steps.

&#8211; First, avoid saying that I&#8217;ll do anything that I can&#8217;t actually do. Make as few promises as possible until I get the hang of doing everything I say I&#8217;ll do.

&#8211; Make everything I say I&#8217;ll do, highly visible. Trello boards. Post it notes. In my notebook. (Here there&#8217;s a task to be made for thinking about how to do this better.)

&#8211; Peg an estimated time cost to everything that I say I&#8217;ll do.

&#8211; Write down why I&#8217;m doing something. Why does it matter to me? What is the desired outcome? Who or what does it help?

&#8211; Write down what I need to have before I can do it. What are the moving parts? What are the black boxes that need to beilluminated?

&#8211; Go through the list of things that I&#8217;ve already said I&#8217;ll do. If there&#8217;s anything that can be done in a couple of minutes, I should do it. If there&#8217;s anything that&#8217;s not really worth doing, I should get rid of it. Classic GTD, isn&#8217;t it?

&#8211; Daily reviews. How do I make sure I keep up with them? I should add a task to my daily rewire app that I&#8217;ve been using quite consistently. I have to buy the upgrade if I want to add more tasks that I&#8217;m already using. It&#8217;s only $6. I&#8217;ve been using it regularly. Done, buying it now. Done.

Ugh, this all really just feels like I&#8217;m running the same old ground over and over again, to be honest. Do I really need to write another vomit about this? Wasn&#8217;t there a meta-point I was trying to make about how I get caught up writing about starting conditions? Here I&#8217;m writing about the basic steps I need to take, the prescriptive stuff. I already know these things, so why am I writing about them again? Because I need a reminder? Fair enough, I guess, but there&#8217;s something inelegant and repetitive about this process. I&#8217;ve written before that if repetition is what is necessary, then that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do, but I&#8217;m starting to think that the repetition isn&#8217;t enough. I can&#8217;t just keep walking the same old ground.

I think what&#8217;s really happening here is this: I&#8217;m not supposed to be writing right now. I&#8217;m forcing myself. I&#8217;m distracting myself. There&#8217;s something else I should be doing. I should be working on, well, work. Or if I&#8217;m taking a break from work, then I should be doing something else rather than writing another vomit. I should be doing the bookkeeping of these vomits instead, if I&#8217;m determined to be doing some work here. I guess I&#8217;m writing this second vomit because I felt like I didn&#8217;t like the last vomit, and I wrote that one because I need to write a vomit every day, and because it was about something that was vaguely on my mind.

It probably would&#8217;ve made more sense to write vomits that I&#8217;ve listed for myself in my todo list. Oh well. I&#8217;m not in the mood to write another vomit after this, not right now. So I&#8217;ll just spend maybe 25 minutes doing a v1 of a sort of big picture sweep/overview.

Done for now.

[1] I wonder, though, if I&#8217;ve addressed these questions before earlier in my word vomits? Lately I&#8217;m starting to realize that it&#8217;s getting likelier and likelier that whenever I find myself troubled by some thought, I&#8217;ve actually already thought about it before. I just haven&#8217;t internalized it fully. Thinking about it again from the start seems slightly wasteful. If I had a better tagging/searching system, if I had a smart system that could surface to me &#8220;you&#8217;re writing X, you&#8217;ve written about it before here&#8221;, that would be really awesome. But for the time being I&#8217;m going to have to be that system. Right now I make sure I write at least one word vomit every day. This is my second of the day. I should probably then spend some fixed amount of time going through my existing vomits and putting them into neat and tidy categories, so that I can find relevant writing on whatever it is I&#8217;m thinking about.
