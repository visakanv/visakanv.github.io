Back for number 4 at 0633hrs. There&#8217;s something very calming about writing in this Byword screen, which is all minimalist and black, with a counter at the bottom. It&#8217;s interesting to think about how my writing medium has changed over the years. I started out doing the word vomits directly into wordpress, I think. And then I started using this app called Write or Die, which had a timer and a word counter. Eventually I switched to writing in Evernote for mobile, and I would write in wordcounter.com for the counter. Finally I bought an app (after over 400,000 words!) that&#8217;s pleasurable to write in.

I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s a lesson here. The first thought I had is, &#8220;The lesson here is that I ought to treat myself to good tools whenever I&#8217;m working on anything&#8221;, but I know that&#8217;s not necessarily true. Your first guitar shouldn&#8217;t be amazing. It should be cheap and hardy, and you should play it to pieces until you develop a sense of what you like and dislike on guitars. And of course you should play around with other guitars too, when you can. But only after a year or so of playing with your first guitar will you really develop a sense, I think, of what you like in a guitar. And then you can / should get a better one.

This advice of course assumes that you&#8217;re broke. If you&#8217;re rich, just get a guitarist you trust to help you choose a good one. But even then&#8230; there&#8217;s a chance you&#8217;ll waste your money because she bought something that&#8217;s better for her than for you. If she&#8217;s smart, she&#8217;ll ask you questions about what your favorite songs are, what sort of music you like, and infer from that what&#8217;s closest to your favorite sound, but even that&#8217;s kinda rubbishy because you don&#8217;t know anything about your optimal string height, string thickness, and if you&#8217;re not playing a lot of music yet, you don&#8217;t actually know what your &#8220;true preferences&#8221; are. At least, in terms of direction. Nobody ever really absolutely knows what their true preferences are, and maybe true preferences aren&#8217;t even a real thing. But you develop an idea with time and experience, at least of where you want to be searching.

So&#8230; maybe buying a writing app early on would have guilt-tripped me into writing more. But I&#8217;m not so sure about that. Maybe I bought it at precisely the right time I was supposed to buy it. I&#8217;m not sure if I can generalize anything out of this. I guess if there are things that are affordable but I&#8217;m not buying because I don&#8217;t feel ready for them, I should just buy them anyway (and reduce spending on more frivolous things if possible). Air conditioning was a great idea, I wish I got it earlier. A foldable dinner table was a great idea, wish I got that earlier. Macbook was a great idea, same. Monitor was a good idea, took me a while to find a good placement for it. Jury&#8217;s still out, but I like having access to it. Razr keyboard was a bad idea– I should&#8217;ve tested it before buying it. I fell in love with the idea of it and had never tried it before. Turns out that it&#8217;s a little too clunky for my taste, and all the additional key mapping stuff just complicates things for me. I&#8217;m not a pro-gamer. The Mac keyboard turned out to be all I needed, which I should&#8217;ve gotten earlier.

I maybe should&#8217;ve gotten a guitar amp earlier, I waited quite a while for that. But I have one now and I&#8217;m happy. Maybe I&#8217;ll get a better one after a year or so of playing around. I might get a better guitar or simply get my current one set up better, there&#8217;s something not quite right about the knobs and the pickups. I have all these books that I want to read.

What do I mean when I say that I want to read? &#8220;I want to read&#8221; is not a very useful statement. I want to do a lot of things. Everything. Wants are infinite. What are my priorities? Writing these word vomits are a priority for me, which is why I&#8217;m writing them at 640am in the morning. Where does reading come in? What do I really want to read? My kindle is full of books that I thought I wanted to read but I don&#8217;t really feel like reading, and I should get rid of those.

I guess I explored this a little with the ideascapes vomit earlier– I want to read things that expand my mind, and lately it feels like the best way to expand my mind is to reconfigure my mental models. Also the &#8220;Poor Little Me&#8221; idea alone is quite revolutionary and I still haven&#8217;t properly internalized it. I should probably spend some time meditating on that fact. Also there&#8217;s a bunch of work I want to do that I keep saying I want to do that I haven&#8217;t done. I started a vomit saying &#8220;The Athlete Must Play Hurt&#8221;, I guess I&#8217;ll finish that one after I finish this one.

Where am I going with all of this, where was I going? It started with a thought about my writing tool (this Byword app), and went on to me thinking about all the other tools in my life. Tools aren&#8217;t just tools, they&#8217;re ways of thinking and ways of expressing ourselves, and so it&#8217;s important to have good tools. But good tools aren&#8217;t entirely an objective thing. A tool&#8217;s utility is a function of what you&#8217;re using it to do, and you need to know what you want to do, and you learn what you want to do by doing things badly.

So what do I want to do? I want to read, I have books and a kindle. Are there other reading technologies I should consider? Does my online reading matter enough that I should design the experience better? I guess I&#8217;ll add that to my todo list and get to it if I feel like it. Does my todo list system matter enough that I should design my experience better? YES, definitely. So I&#8217;ll add that too.

It&#8217;s interesting how, in a &#8220;state of cognition&#8221;, it&#8217;s clear that all of the tools are ultimately&#8230; manifestations? Of patterns of action and behavior. I realize this from time to time. At the heart of everything is the story we tell ourselves about ourselves, what we believe we&#8217;re worth, what we believe we want, deserve. And tinkering with a todo list can be a sort of distraction if you&#8217;re not sure what it&#8217;s all for. The kicker is you&#8217;ll NEVER be sure what it&#8217;s all for, and you got to sort of pick something and run with it, and refine things along the way.

I understand this when it comes to writing, and I think I understand it when it comes to music, so I just need to extrapolate this and understand it when it comes to life.
