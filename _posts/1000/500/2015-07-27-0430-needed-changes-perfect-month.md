I&#8217;m writing this vomit by picking something from my to-do list. Somewhere– maybe a few vomits ago– I thought to myself that I need to sit down and think about the changes that need to happen, and write very specifically about that. I didn&#8217;t really feel it too strongly at the time.

But right now, I don&#8217;t really feel about writing about anything else, either. I don&#8217;t feel like writing about big picture things, I don&#8217;t feel like I have the right to, and I don&#8217;t feel like I have anything interesting to say right now. [1]

So&#8230; what are the changes that need to happen?

I think the most important things are– I need to plan my days. I need to have daily reviews at the beginning and end of each day. I need to have a more deliberate routine after I wake up, and a more deliberate routine after I get to work, and in both cases I need to make sure that I&#8217;m prioritizing what&#8217;s important to me.

I&#8217;ve written about this many times&#8230; for these things to work I need to have some sort of stakes. I need to see very clearly how it&#8217;s going to make my life better. To get a bit meta– I don&#8217;t really feel like doing a word vomit right now. I&#8217;m tired. It&#8217;s late. I&#8217;m writing anyway because this project is important to me.

Ugh, something about that sentence bothers me. I know, I know, actions are all that count, good intentions aren&#8217;t very useful. Good intentions are wisps, imaginary, weightless. I have good intentions about writing 1,000,000 words, and I&#8217;m executing on that intention every single day. I also have good intentions about helping to grow my company at work, but somehow that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m not making as much of a difference to. I&#8217;m putting in the word every day, but not with the same sort of persistence, not with the same sort of intensity.

I don&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s simply a matter of how badly I want it. I&#8217;m pretty sure I want to be successful at work every bit as much as I want to successfully complete my word vomit project. I think the disparity between the two really, really boils down to how I&#8217;m managing the respective projects. The 1000 word vomit project is beautifully designed– so simple, so elegant. 1000 words a day, that&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s irrefutable.

In contrast, what I need to do for work is far more nebulous. There are many more such tasks. What I need to do is to associate my work with something as discrete, as specific and irrefutable as writing a word vomit.

Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking. For a period of time I was using a spindle, both at work and at home, to keep track of tasks that I was doing. Everytime I did a task, I&#8217;d write it on a post-it pierce it on the spindle. But after a while I started to feel less strongly about the spindles. They were &#8220;diluted&#8221;, because I was piercing all sorts of simple things like &#8220;did the dishes&#8221;. A year&#8217;s worth of doing the dishes isn&#8217;t really an accomplishment worth celebrating. It&#8217;s not a stretch goal.

I definitely enjoyed the spindle while I was using it. So I think I should be able to re-create that habit. So here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do. I&#8217;m going to restart both the spindles– at home and at work. The goal is to start a streak of having daily reviews. I&#8217;ve been doing work reviews at the end of the day– this is too reactive. I should be more proactive. I should plan my tasks at the start of the day, using my stated priorities as a guide. If I just work on 3 things that are at the top of the list– whether they&#8217;re all sub-tasks of the highest priority thing, or it&#8217;s one sub-task per each of the top 3 things, then I&#8217;d have earned the right to pierce a task on a spindle. And I&#8217;ll attempt to have a streak of 100 post-its pierced on the spindle.

Am I missing something here? I&#8217;m not as excited about this as I ought to be. When I first conceived of the 1,000 word vomits project, I remember being insanely excited. It was so clear that it was going to be something magical to overcome. 100 work plans somehow doesn&#8217;t feel the same. It&#8217;s something that I should do, I know, but I have a long list of things that I should do. What&#8217;s something that I really, really, WANT to do? Something exciting? That I could tie together with my daily plans?

I need to remind myself why it&#8217;s important, what happens when it works, what happens when it doesn&#8217;t work.

And maybe I should just commit to making August a great month. When I&#8217;m done with this month, July would&#8217;ve been short of 1 day to have been a perfect streak of word vomits. I intend to have August have a perfect streak. Might as well have daily reviews to accompany it. The Perfect Month. That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s pretty exciting. That&#8217;s something I feel like I can get behind.

I might be wrong, I might change my mind. One thing I&#8217;ve been innoculated against in these vomits is making overly grand promises, because I don&#8217;t know what I can or cannot do. But I intend to try. A perfect streak in August it is, then. Well planned, well-rested. Let&#8217;s do it.

[1] I was just tweeting about language and tech and media this morning, and I got that out of my system. But I don&#8217;t really want to sit down and write essays about it. Essays are for proper exploring&#8230; and I&#8217;m not in the mood for exploring &#8216;the stars&#8217; when I haven&#8217;t explored the area in my immediate vicinity.

Also, &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like I have the right to&#8221; and &#8220;I don&#8217;t have anything interesting to say right now&#8221; is a passing mood. It&#8217;s interesting to observe. It&#8217;s a function of how I&#8217;m feeling at a given time. And this isn&#8217;t my dominant state, obviously. It&#8217;s interesting to think about how I feel this way. I suppose it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s after feeling a little unproductive.
