Well, this is hilarious. I started on this vomit, and then I sort of got distracted and wandered off, and I ended up taking 2 full hours to complete it because I was doing so many other things in between. It was a pretty generic vomit with me just talking about how I need to sleep earlier, wake earlier, have a better morning routine, and how I&#8217;m going to use post-its on my bedroom wall to keep track of all the different things I do in a day, and figure out a fixed optimal order for doing them rather than thinking and deciding what to do each day (which is a waste of time).

It stretched out for a thousand words, and I hit publish and it just disappeared. (This is an annoying thing that WordPress does over and over again. It happened a lot on my work blog, too. Why must you kill people&#8217;s work, WordPress?)

So now I&#8217;m in a different mood. I&#8217;m avenging the vomit that was lost. And I have to figure out something else to say, and say it quickly becaus I don&#8217;t want to sleep at 2am.

I like challenges like these, I guess. I find myself thinking about the role of emotion in writing. And how if you write really fast without thinking, your writing (ideally) just becomes a reflection of whatever emotional state you&#8217;re in– or just whatever &#8220;state&#8221; you&#8217;re in, period. I was listening to Alan Watts and he was talking about how there&#8217;s some artist with long hair, who covers his hair in paint and then swings it at the canvas– and then he observes it and does a sort of Rorschach test on it, and from that he infers what the painting should be and then paints THAT. It&#8217;s an interesting way to approach constraints.

Which in turn reminds me of something Ray Bradbury said about writing down nouns&#8230; I really do think I should start writing short stories in the context of these word vomits. I&#8217;m probably hesitating because I&#8217;m a bit afraid, because I haven&#8217;t done it before. But hey, that&#8217;s the point, right? 444 vomits in and I&#8217;ve settled into this comfortable pattern of talking about my personal issues over and over again. I really ought to ban myself from writing about these things at least for a couple of hundred vomits, so that I can write other things for a change. For a period of time I was banning myself from writing social commentary type things, because those things were keeping me from paying attention to myself. Now I&#8217;ve spent like 400,000 words paying attention to myself, and it definitely feels like I&#8217;m not going to be thinking/writing my way out of this one. Rather, I have to just stay mindful of it and do more hard, challenging work.

So these word vomits shouldn&#8217;t be so easy anymore. They shouldn&#8217;t be as mindless and blurty as they are right now. I mean, they&#8217;re always going to be blurty in the sense that I&#8217;m not going to edit them very much if at all, but I&#8217;m getting really tired of just talking about myself, talking with my own voice, yadda yadda. I had a pretty good time with the A / B dialogues, but even those were pretty obviously just different facets of my own personality, or me talking to myself in the mirror. I need to try something different altogether. And so it&#8217;s probably time to dig out my list of short story ideas and stuff and just get cracking.

Since I still have more time in this vomit I&#8217;ll spend it thinking about how I&#8217;ll pick what to write. I feel like I have some sort of burden or responsibility to write about things that aren&#8217;t trivial. I don&#8217;t want to be writing the same sort of essays that I used to write for Poached Magazine.

Well&#8230; technically I can start by writing about trivial things if I want to. But do I actually want to? This is a silly, pointless train of thought. I am in charge. I decide what I do. I decide what I want to do. So what do I decide I want to do? What would be the coolest thing for me to publish next, as a word vomit, as a short story, or as dialogue? No, I don&#8217;t want to just do a little dialogue. I want to do stories. Well, how am I going to define what a story is? Am I just going to describe a fictional environment? Am I going to describe a single fictional person? Am I going to describe some sort of conflict? I suppose I could run through each of those things. I&#8217;m not obliged to write self-contained stories right at the start. I can do snippets, little notes. I can do criticisms and analyses of existing books and of characters. These wouldn&#8217;t be pointless, they&#8217;ll help me figure out what I want to write later on. As long as I&#8217;m doing it for that purpose, and not _utterly_ mindless self-indulgence, that that&#8217;s okay. Mindless self indulgence is ALSO okay, but I&#8217;d like to do better than that. I don&#8217;t want to take random walks in purely random directions when I can take a semi-random walk in a semi-deliberate direction that I know is likely to be better for me.

So&#8230; yeah. Maybe I&#8217;ll do movie reviews too. I think I&#8217;ll do movie / book reviews in the form of conversations between characters that I&#8217;ll develop, within some context that I&#8217;ll develop. Yes, that sounds like something slightly out of my comfort zone, in the sense that it&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m already doing, and yet it sounds achievable. It&#8217;s a pleasant stretch. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do.

It does seem a little crazy ambitious to try to write 500,000 words worth of little stories and such. But really, a million words of anything is pretty crazy. I might as well direct my exploration in some sort of interesting direction. At the end of it all I can pour the molten aluminum (or whatever it is they pour) down this ant hill to see what the network looks like, where it leads, how it&#8217;s all interconnected, and what I want to do from there.

Done.
