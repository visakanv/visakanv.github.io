Had a couple of interesting conversations at work today that I want to explore a little more fully.

The first is about what it&#8217;s like when I&#8217;ve decided to commit to something, and find myself slipping. This happens over and over again in my life, to the point where it&#8217;s practically a part of me. It&#8217;s crept into my spinal cord, probably. Underneath my stated beliefs, which I am capable of mouthing without actually thinking very hard (I&#8217;ve been re-reading Power of Habit, and it&#8217;s interesting to read about people with brain damage who&#8217;re still very capable of constructing logical-sounding explanations for things). It&#8217;s weird. I&#8217;ve spent so much of my life trying to get better at thinking and explaining and all that, and then I come to this point (I&#8217;ve been here before) where I realize that all of that can actually be diversionary. They allow me to come up with paths around things that make me uncomfortable. It&#8217;s rationalization. I&#8217;ve written this before, but I&#8217;m writing it again anyway. I might be doing it in the hope that repetition makes things stick better. [1]

The thing I need to repeat is the fact that explanation and rationalization and all of those things come after the fact. I should instead study the evidence. I was watching Dr. House with my wife and it was interesting to see a few bits where the doctors were visibly fixated on some theory or another. We all obviously do that over and over again. It&#8217;s a challenge to let go. I suppose that&#8217;s what meditation is for. And I haven&#8217;t quite stuck to that as much as I say I want to. I haven&#8217;t quite made it as much of the priority I say I want it to be.

Well, I&#8217;m learning. I wish I could go faster. I feel like there&#8217;s some sort of zen lesson for me to learn here– that I can&#8217;t go faster without slowing down. That I need to really sharpen my saw, tune my guitar, so on. 

But that still doesn&#8217;t answer the question I need to answer, which is– how have I kept myself going? How have I kept doing the updates that I&#8217;ve been wanting to do? It might be a little premature to talk about it now– I&#8217;ve only kept it going for 4 weeks. I want to do 12 weeks. And I want to make sure I don&#8217;t give up thereafter. And I also want to keep to my exercise, my reading, my meditation, all of those things. How do I do that? It seems like introducing stakes is part of the solution. I&#8217;m feeling tired now. (I was writing the second part of this vomit before the first.) I&#8217;m going to have to ride this one out to the end, and then I&#8217;m going to have to rest. But I have to stick with it. I have to keep coming back. I have to keep trying again and again before I get it. 

I feel like it might just be the weight of growing up. I don&#8217;t have as much time to waste anymore. But I still certainly waste time, when I&#8217;m not quite all cognitively there. So&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ll meditate on it.

&#8212;&#8211;

The second is about what it&#8217;s like when I feel confused by, afraid of or repulsed by the &#8220;foggy black boxes&#8221;. In the context of work, I&#8217;m talking about things that I have not thought about too much, or done very much about, because I don&#8217;t really know very much about them and I assume they&#8217;re not a high priority. But they&#8217;re things that bug me anyway, perhaps because I sense there&#8217;s something important or useful behind the fog. I&#8217;m sure there are many things I know nothing about that don&#8217;t bother me at all&#8230; are there? It&#8217;s interesting. There are many different classes of things that I do not know very much about.

The simple takeaway was that I shouldn&#8217;t be so afraid to talk to people about things that I&#8217;m unsure about, that I do not understand. I admire one of my colleagues for being very comfortable with saying &#8220;I have no idea what you just said.&#8221; I&#8217;m happy to concede that I don&#8217;t know about something, but I&#8217;m not so good at saying I didn&#8217;t understand what you said (instead I&#8217;ll try my best to interpret it, and I imagine people often accept our interpretations of things becaus the effort needed to really be rigorous about making sense of things through communication is insanely hard). I&#8217;m also not good at approaching people with &#8220;Hey, I don&#8217;t know very much about this and I want to know more.&#8221; 

At this point I Googled &#8220;what to do when you don&#8217;t know what to do&#8221; and I actually found a nice article on TinyBuddha that kind of captures it for me. It really does seem to all boil down to this general anxiousness that I have. Maybe it&#8217;s from my childhood or from failures or whatever, maybe it&#8217;s guilt, whatever it is. It&#8217;s here. It&#8217;s not helpful. I have to ask it to leave. And I have to do it firmly but nicely, with kindness. And I have to be calm about it.

[1] It&#8217;s interesting to read my old work. I&#8217;ve done a bit of it. I should and want to do more of it. In particular, I&#8217;m interested at how sometimes I repeat things that I&#8217;ve read or heard elsewhere in an attempt to sort of internalize what I&#8217;m saying. I parrot all these theories and stuff. I&#8217;ve been doing it ever since I started blogging. When I read that now, it&#8217;s quite transparent and I can see where my &#8220;original&#8221; thoughts were and where I was mainly trying to use whatever it was I had my brain wrapped around at the moment. And yet nowadays when I talk, or respond to things, I find it very difficult to isolate my influences. There seems to be a little bit of everything. It seems like all of the characters I&#8217;ve brought into my head began to talk to each other and intertwine with each other and I can&#8217;t quite tell where one begins and another ends.
