Second set of things on my mind– thoughts while re-reading old word vomits. The first and most pressing thought is that I&#8217;ve already covered &#8216;pretty much everything&#8217; that I thought I needed to write, at least for a first cut or a first run. I&#8217;ve been spending my time re-writing and re-creating things from scratch that I had already written before. It&#8217;s a strange feeling when I read something from a few months ago, or even a year ago, and find that it&#8217;s somehow more true or more appropriate about something than something I&#8217;ve just written. I wonder if that&#8217;s just a perspective thing. It&#8217;s probably a selection bias thing, like how the queue that you&#8217;re standing in is unlikely to be the fastest queue (and when it is, you don&#8217;t really notice it), so it always seems like you&#8217;re stuck in a slow queue or the slowest queue. Similarly, when looking back, I probably quickly gloss over the word vomits that weren&#8217;t that great, and linger on the ones that were good. Maybe. That&#8217;s a rational, reasonable-sounding explanation.

Still, I&#8217;d like to keep getting better at what I do. And a big part of that means I need to be systematic. I can&#8217;t keep reinventing the wheel, that&#8217;s taking too much time and is a frustrating process. I should incorporate the (good) old stuff into the new. I&#8217;m not doing that enough– or I&#8217;m relying entirely on memory, which isn&#8217;t working out so well when I have hundreds of different vomits to remember. I only remember maybe 10% of what&#8217;s actually useful, and forget 90%. We&#8217;re back to the idea of having to repeat things&#8230; I&#8217;ve DEFINITELY written a word vomit about that.

I suppose then we&#8217;re also reaching an interesting stage where I&#8217;ve almost definitely written about almost everything that I think I like to think about, or need to think about. Is there anything that I need to think about that I haven&#8217;t already written or thought about? Probably not. It&#8217;s all just actions that I need to take that I haven&#8217;t taken. I&#8217;m writing this at 12:52am when I was hoping to be asleep by 12. So that&#8217;s rather silly. But let me just steamroller through this one and get to bed.

So what does all this tell me about what I should do next? I&#8217;m still going to keep to my &#8220;publish at least one word vomit a day&#8221; system, because I know that publishing is therapeutic and a good habit to build. When I stop publishing, I start drying up in all sorts of ways. But beyond that, it&#8217;s actually really more important that I continue to summarize and re-read old vomits. I&#8217;m up to at least one summary (10 vomits at a time) a day now, and maybe I&#8217;ll try and get most of them done over the long weekend. That does some like a pursuit worth indulging in. The end result would be&#8230; I want to have a map of my recurring thoughts and ideas, and I want to see how many different ways I&#8217;ve approached things, and what sort of progress I&#8217;ve made. I&#8217;ve been putting it off partially because it&#8217;s tedious work, but more because I don&#8217;t know how good it&#8217;ll be. I&#8217;m imagining it&#8217;ll be messy and incomplete and imperfect. But those are necessary first steps towards achieving anything, so I need to shake off the subconscious BS idea that undone is better than badly/imperfectly done. Badly/imperfectly done is the first step towards a system of recurring improvement.

Beyond that, I think I&#8217;m pretty happy with how my vomit process is turning out. Publishing once a day is great. Keeping track of the publish days and keeping track of the total number published is great.

I was conscious in the shower earlier of how the word vomit project that I&#8217;ve committed to has put me in a position where I haven&#8217;t really been doing any social commentary or public facing writing. Initially, I swore off that kind of stuff because it felt like a distraction– and it most definitely was. What&#8217;s the point of being clear about public issues if I&#8217;m not clear about my own personal issues? But I do also think that I have a certain need for engagement with the outside world, otherwise I feel a little cloistered inside my own head and I go a little bit mad.

But I can&#8217;t exactly go back to writing things the way I used to. I&#8217;m not the same person anymore. I don&#8217;t care about the same things anymore. What would I be writing if I didn&#8217;t have a word vomit project to work on? I think I would be writing something like, &#8220;The Recreational Public Outrage Machine&#8221;. Suppose that is written. What would I write next? &#8220;What Adults Would Tell You About Adulthood (If They Weren&#8217;t So Goddamn Tired)&#8221; might be another. Suppose that&#8217;s done. What next? Coping With Everyday Bullshit. But I&#8217;m not qualified to write that yet, because I haven&#8217;t exactly figured that shit out myself. Suppose that&#8217;s written. What do I really want to write? Pursuing New Friendships In Adulthood (?). Not even sure if I&#8217;d really do that one. Suppose that&#8217;s done. &#8220;Stuff We Don&#8217;t Talk About (That I Kinda Wish We Did).&#8221; Done. &#8220;After A While People Aren&#8217;t That Interesting&#8221;. Not sure if I actually agree with that, but it would be interesting to write. &#8220;We&#8217;re All Connected, Okay Then What?&#8221; Next. &#8220;We Tolerate Really Low Standards For Some Reason&#8221;. That one might be a fun satire piece, Onion style. Actually there are probably a whole bunch of fun satire pieces to be written about marketing and startups. But is that really what I care about? Well, if I thought about it, it&#8217;s probably worth writing it and getting it out of the way (as part of a writing project, not necessarily as a top priority altogether.) The Game Of Priorities is something I might write about in my next vomit, because it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m actually concerned about right now and has direct implications for my own life.

Well, we&#8217;re done with this one. Goodnight.
