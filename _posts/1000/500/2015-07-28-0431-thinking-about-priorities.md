My subconscious doesn&#8217;t seem to grasp the idea that I&#8217;ve done over 400 vomits. I write &#8220;242&#8221; instead of &#8220;422&#8221;, and yesterday &#8220;340&#8221; instead of &#8220;430&#8221;. It&#8217;s amusing.

I had a conversation with a colleague yesterday, and I was discussing my general akrasia and (relative) unproductivity. And he said something that hit me particularly hard, in a good way.

He asked how I typically start my day, and how I manage my time, to which I admitted that I typically don&#8217;t really start on my top priority tasks until the later half of the workday. [1] He matter-of-factly noted, I paraphrase, &#8220;So the things that you say are a priority to you aren&#8217;t actually a priority?&#8221;

Which, if I resist any attempt to explain away, I realize must be true. I mean, it might be an oversimplification, there might be something in the way, blah blah blah, but ultimately reality doesn&#8217;t give a shit, and from reality&#8217;s point of view, if a person says something is important but nothing happens about it, it&#8217;s not important.

Uhh. I feel like I&#8217;ve walked over this ground many, many times before. With repetition, these ideas are closer to the forefront of my mind, or they&#8217;re more a part of my thinking than before (when they were [truth-in-boxes](http://visakanv.com/1000/0400-truth-in-boxes/)). But if progress is still elusive (and to be fair, I have made a bunch of progress. I&#8217;m just constantly trying to be more effective, to do more.)

I guess the challenge here is to hold contradictory ideas in my mind. (I&#8217;m stealing this idea from [Adulthood Is A Scary Horse](http://captainawkward.com/2013/01/24/437/).) What I&#8217;m doing right now is jumping between them, back and forth, without quite holding both in my head at the same time.

  1. If I say that something matters to me, and I&#8217;m not doing something about it, that means I&#8217;m blocked in some way, and I should identify that blockage and remove it. After all, if that something really matters to me, it&#8217;s worth doing, right?
  2. If I say that something matters to me, or I talk about doing something that matters to something beyond myself, and I&#8217;m not doing something about it, that means that for all practical purposes, the world will interpret it to mean &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t really matter to him, he&#8217;s just saying it&#8221;.

Brain in your head, feet in your shoes. If they&#8217;re not working in tandem, nothing makes sense and everything is crazy.

Uh, so what now?

It&#8217;s interesting. I wanted to go to bed early last night and wake up early. But at about 11pm, I felt a strange compulsion to pick up this 1000-part connect the dots puzzlebook that my wife has, and I sat down and starting connecting. I tried to be disciplined about it and connect 1-2-3-4 and so on, and I did that up to about 100. And then I started skipping around, which is a great way to make sure that you have to subsequently trouble yourself going over earlier spaces multiple times to make sure that you didn&#8217;t miss anything.

Once I started, it was like a challenge to myself to complete it in a single sitting. And I did, I completed it. I persisted. Was that something to be proud of? Uh. Again, it&#8217;s like being really good at your 2nd highest priority. It&#8217;s a sort of pyrhhic victory. I can acknowledge that I made progress on something, but if it&#8217;s not on my highest priority, I&#8217;m sort of wasting my time. I&#8217;m being suboptimal. And being optimal is a valid option here, so where I can I should pick that valid option.

Also, minor lesson learnt in a visceral way– if there&#8217;s an order to be followed to prevent double-work, follow that order. Unless I have a really, really good reason for screwing around, apart from &#8220;let&#8217;s screw around and see what happens&#8221;. [2]

Anyway, the point is&#8230; I went to bed later than intended. But I woke up at 7am when my alarm went off. In contrast, my alarm also went off yesterday when I had some time-sensitive work I wanted to, but I went right back to bed.

There&#8217;s a really important question in there that I need to figure out the answer to. Why is it that sometimes I can&#8217;t wake up even when I&#8217;m trying to will myself to wake up, in a very deliberate sense, and yet sometimes I can lightly think about waking up, and then react so &#8216;positively&#8217; to the alarm? (My definition of &#8220;positive&#8221; is still a rather bleary-eyed, fumbling sort of thing. Unlike Bear Grylls, who apparently calls his alarm clock his &#8220;opportunity clock&#8221;.)

Anyway, I suppose for the time being I should just try to repeat what happened.

Also: Writing word vomits are important to me, so I write them everyday. Prioritizing my work is important to me too, and I&#8217;m going to do that every day too from now on. There are some next steps there to make sure I stick to it, I&#8217;m adding that to my to-do.

\_____

[1] I tend to spend a lot of the start just flaffing around, doing less-important tasks. I have all sorts of explanations and justifications in my head– maybe I&#8217;m not warmed up yet, or maybe I work better in the evening&#8230; but I also know that none of these explanations are iron-clad. They&#8217;re all after-the-fact, made up. And the fact that I&#8217;m not as productive as I want to be has bothered me, even if nobody&#8217;s talking to me about it. I know this. I think about it all the time. (Which is unproductive&#8230; at least until I finally do something about it.)

Here I find myself thinking of Dr. Seuss&#8217;s &#8220;Oh, the places you&#8217;ll go!&#8221;. &#8220;You have brains in your head and feet in your shoes,&#8221; he wrote. I find myself thinking&#8230; the brains-in-your-head part isn&#8217;t a problem. It&#8217;s the feet-in-your-shoes bit that usually get me. I don&#8217;t have that practical, bodily intelligence of &#8216;moving my feet&#8217;. Extraverted Thinking, in MBTI terms. I should probably read the whole thing and maybe do a vomit/review of it.

[2] UNLESS &#8220;screwing around&#8221; is a completely valid option– that is, I somehow happen to have a chunk of free time and I&#8217;m more interested in screwing around than completing something. But this is becoming less and less probable– I spent a lot of my life screwing around, and so I feel like I&#8217;ve learnt a lot of what there is to be learnt about screwing around. In contrast, I have a lot to learn about completing things. So I should more often than not prioritize completing things. This may change one day. I will know when it does.
