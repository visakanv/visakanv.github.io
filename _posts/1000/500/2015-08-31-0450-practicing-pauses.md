I&#8217;ve been taking a break from writing for a while but now I&#8217;m back. I initially hoped to have August be my &#8220;perfect streak&#8221; writing month, but I just got really tired and writing started to feel like a chore so I stopped. But now I&#8217;m back, and I don&#8217;t want to agonize too much or waste time with self-flagellation. There&#8217;s always time for that later.

So I&#8217;m back, and I&#8217;m fresh. What am I going to do? What do I focus on, with regards to this project? Before I stopped, I wrote one fiction piece and hoped to write many more fiction pieces. I felt a bit overwhelmed at the prospect and it seemed a little premature. So maybe I won&#8217;t do that yet.

I mentioned in a piece of writing- not sure if I published it- that I want to split my writing into &#8220;motivations&#8221;, &#8220;observations&#8221;, &#8220;hypotheses&#8221;, &#8220;howtos&#8221;. Maybe more buckets than that, but that&#8217;s the rough breakdown.

My highest priority in life at the time of this writing is to get enough sleep, to eat healthier and to hit the gym.

I had a week about two weeks ago- when I first stopped writing- where I&#8217;d sleep really early every single day. And that was good for me, I got a lot of mental clarity from it. And then I got a little sloppy the week after- I was meeting friends and just &#8220;enjoying&#8221; having time and space to myself (since my wife&#8217;s away right now). I will still be meeting people this week, but I&#8217;ll try to sleep as early as possible nevertheless.

I know very clearly now that this is the number one thing I want to solve. I don&#8217;t want to finish 1000 word vomits but still be writing at word vomit 999 that I really ought to be sleeping better. I&#8217;ve been writing about that for almost 10 years now. Solving sleep is the most important, high-leverage thing I can do for myself. I&#8217;ve hit the gym two weeks running, doing big heavy compound exercises. It feels really good. I look forward to getting stronger. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to do at least once a week indefinitely. Let&#8217;s commit to 12 sessions (so that&#8217;s 10 more that need to happen) before I&#8217;ll write a report or finding of some sort.

Motivations. I&#8217;ve even feeling a little sentimental the last few days, nostalgic and all. I think it was a passing phase, and it was necessary, maybe. I don&#8217;t want to overthink it, just acknowledging it and moving past it. I want to do more to help myself, help my colleagues. I want to continue to improve my information diet. There&#8217;s really nothing on Facebook that&#8217;s worth reading. I&#8217;d prefer instead to read Seneca and Montaigne and so on. I need to revisit my personal todo list, which I haven&#8217;t done in a while.

Why not? Why isn&#8217;t that already a part of my daily routine? I guess it seems or feels somehow uncomfortable, somehow unpleasant. Why? Because it involves thinking about things that I haven&#8217;t done, which is uncomfortable. But I know intellectually that I need to do uncomfortable things. I don&#8217;t need to spend hours watching skilled people at work, or talking about their work, or reading articles written about such people. I need to develop my own skills. I don&#8217;t need to worry about local politics, which ultimately doesn&#8217;t affect me as much as it&#8217;s tempting to think.

I sometimes still post comments and such in spaces that don&#8217;t really matter.

I paused for a second right there to look for distractions. It&#8217;s a sort of sugar craving, a craving for some sort of interaction to busy myself with. What I&#8217;m trying to do (and what I just did) is to pause instead, to turn away from whatever I&#8217;m doing, to focus on breathing and to just pay attention to my mind. A sort of micro-meditation. And almost always I find that my breathing has been shallow, and that my posture is usually slouched. So what I&#8217;m trying to do instead, when I feel the urge to be distracted, is to interpret that as a cue to straighten up. Grab some water. Stretch. Eat some peanuts. (This is also the little space where I used to smoke cigarettes.)

I think a big mistake I&#8217;ve been making is pretending that I can just ignore these gaps, these little bursts of &#8220;I want distraction&#8221;. They were always there and they&#8217;ll probably always be there. The only times they don&#8217;t seem to emerge is when I&#8217;m playing video games or I&#8217;m surfing the Web in a non-directed way, and in both of those cases I&#8217;m constantly getting all sorts of exciting feedback. It&#8217;s the classic slot machine sort of situation. I always want to see what&#8217;s next. I&#8217;m a junkie for that sort of thing.

Pause.

I&#8217;m reminded of my boss&#8217;s suggestion of using a &#8220;brain dump&#8221; to just throw in all the random ideas and thoughts that come into my mind when I encounter them. I tried it for a while and it seemed to work for a bit, but I never really stuck with it. Why? I think it&#8217;s because I wasn&#8217;t framing the problem before. I convince myself that I have all these exciting tangential ideas that might be useful. And sometimes I do. But most of the time the truth is far less interesting, much more mundane. I&#8217;m just itchy. For me to scratch the itch, I don&#8217;t to introduce something genuinely useful. It just needs to be different. When I&#8217;m confronted with something difficult or challenging or boring, anything different is endlessly interesting. This is how I&#8217;ve been systematically robbing myself. (Reminder: no self-flagellation- that too is distracting from problem-solving).

So&#8230; a big part of the solution is to start by framing problems properly, in the smallest possible chunks. This always feels silly or trivial to me, but I have enough experience now to know that it&#8217;s far sillier to keep trying to wing it and fail, over and over again. There&#8217;s a seductive part of my brain that refuses to pay attention to the evidence- it keeps thinking that tomorrow will be different. It won&#8217;t.

The behavior is pathalogical. Every time I think I&#8217;ve got it under control, I&#8217;m wrong. But I&#8217;m going to solve this. I know I haven&#8217;t got it yet, and I probably never will. I&#8217;m going to work assuming it&#8217;ll always be a problem. But I will get on top of this.
