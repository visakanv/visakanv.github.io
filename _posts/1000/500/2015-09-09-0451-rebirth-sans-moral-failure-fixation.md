I&#8217;ve been thinking and talking and writing for some time about how I&#8217;ve needed to experience some sort of rebirth or revival, some sort of transition from boyhood or adolescence to adulthood or &#8220;true&#8221; adulthood.

I struggled to be precise about what exactly was wrong or what exactly needed to happen; what I knew was that I was experiencing a general sense of uneasiness. It was making me feel really uncomfortable. I felt like I didn&#8217;t quite fit in my skin. I was going through everyday life in a bit of a blurry stupor. I was sometimes angry, sometimes ashamed, sometimes frustrated, sometimes sorrowful, sometimes empty. I struggled to be happy, to be calm, to be present, satisfied, appreciative, grateful. [1]

Somewhere along the way since then, I&#8217;ve found myself feeling less trapped and limited. I don&#8217;t want to use words like &#8220;breakthrough&#8221; or &#8220;leap&#8221;, because it doesn&#8217;t feel that way. It feels more like a gentle-but-messy transition that was almost imperceptible day-to-day. The things that have gone into helping me make this shift are hard to pin down. My boss&#8217;s calm, thoughtful and judgement-free questioning has a big role to play in it. So does me having my own home. So do friends who are thoughtful and kind. And I&#8217;ve had mentor-figures help me indirectly– writers (long dead), YouTube personalities, all sorts of folks.

So what&#8217;s changed, exactly?

I&#8217;m probably oversimplifying it, but the biggest and most important change is my attitude towards moral failure. I&#8217;ve come to believe that there&#8217;s something called the Moral Failure Fallacy. (I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a better name for it, or if somebody&#8217;s already written about this.)

I&#8217;ve arrived at this from several different trains of thought. The first thread which is closest to my heart is the moral failing of Laziness, or sloth. I&#8217;ve written about this more extensively in earlier vomits when trying to reflect on my own adolescence. It&#8217;s been a bit too long for me to have super-accurate memories, but I do feel like it was implied to me that I was a lazy person. Even if nobody ever said &#8220;You are lazy&#8221;, there would be questions like &#8220;why are you so lazy?&#8221; or exhortations like &#8220;don&#8217;t be so lazy&#8221;. Laziness is a moral failure, and if you are lazy, you are a bad person. You are not doing what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing. You&#8217;re a lousy human being. Laziness is sinful, and there is no need to ask &#8220;why is that person being lazy?&#8221; Man is considered to be intrinsically sinful.

But I found that hard to swallow, because I&#8217;ve always felt like I care a lot about some things, and that I work really hard at some things, and that I had big dreams and big visions.

Since doing more reading about these things, I find that similar attitudes prevail across all other supposed moral failings. A person with a high sex drive is lustful, which is a moral failing. (We&#8217;re especially judgemental towards women who enjoy sex.) I once wrote a series of posts about how the 7 deadly sins really ought to be thought of as the 7 fundamental drives, and that they&#8217;re only sinful when expressed suboptimally. This is turning out to be more true and more important than I might have conceived of when I was starting out.

Why do people overeat? Why do people under-exercise? Why do people become drug addicts, alcoholics, cheat on their spouses? &#8220;People are bastard coated bastards with bastard filling&#8221;, &#8220;everybody lies&#8221;– why? I am not satisfied with &#8220;because humans are morally flawed&#8221; as an axiomatic truth. It merits further examination. Laziness is task-aversion, and there are many reasons why a person might be averse to a particular task that have little to nothing to do with their intrinsic goodness as a person. In fact, phrases like &#8220;intrinsic goodness&#8221; are distracting and problematic. One of the worst things about the moral gameshow is that we pretend it&#8217;s not a game.

And just&#8230; continue to think about all the ways the world tells us that we&#8217;re shitty people. If you don&#8217;t have a great romantic relationship and a great sex life and great career success something&#8217;s kinda wrong with you. Why aren&#8217;t you seizing the moment? Why aren&#8217;t you taking advantage of this opportunity you&#8217;ve been given? When I look back on my old writing, I see so much guilt. So much subtle stress, a sense that I had to live up to something. To what? To what, actually?

It&#8217;s startling. When I was younger, I thought I was &#8220;philosophical&#8221; and curious and inquisitive, and would be happy and willing to ask all sorts of questions about life, the universe and everything. I expected that deeper psychological satisfaction would come from exploring &#8216;higher&#8217; concepts, more complex ideas about the meaning of meaning and what have you.

And those things are still really interesting, but I&#8217;ve found myself instead primarily focused on examining my own reality. Observing myself. What do I want? What do I care about? Why do I write these word vomits? What am I trying to prove? What am I trying to achieve? What am I afraid of? What am I chasing after? What am I looking forward to? What am I excited about? What am I ashamed of? And what are all these thoughts and ideas grounded in, how are those things constructed? I find myself suddenly curious about nutrition because I realize it has an incredible impact on the quality of my conscious experience. I have some intellectual curiosity about how the human body works, but it becomes so much more compelling when I realize that it has a direct effect on my experience. I get to design my own reality.

But beyond nutrition, I&#8217;m also now curious about moral judgement, and our seemingly intrinsic notions of good and bad. I&#8217;m not curious about this the same way I might&#8217;ve been as a kid– to win arguments, to sound impressive and intellectual, and to feel good about myself for going after such lofty topics. No.

I&#8217;m now concerned about living the remainder of my life without debilitating amounts of guilt, shame, fear, anger, resentment and so on– and I&#8217;ve been trying to examine where all of those things come from. And that examination is proving to lead (quite unsurprisingly, on hindsight) to really old places.

I haven&#8217;t done all the reading (endless task), and I don&#8217;t have all the answers, but I feel like I have a new way of confronting the delightful mess that is my life: it is what it is, it&#8217;s not my fault (but it IS my responsibility), it&#8217;s full of imperfections (both inherited and self-created), and feeling chronically, cripplingly ashamed or guilty about the way things are is profoundly suboptimal.

[1] I&#8217;d like to believe that there was a sense of certainty underneath all of the doubt and psychological contortions. But that&#8217;s actually kind of irrelevant– comforting at best, self-delusional at worst. In reality, unverifiable.
