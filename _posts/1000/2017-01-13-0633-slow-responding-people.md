There&#8217;s something a little strange about me that is a sort of bug that I want to correct. It&#8217;s kind of like &#8220;an island in a lake in an island&#8221; situation.

I generally procrastinate quite a bit, on a lot of things.

At the same time, I have a habit of getting all panicky and rushed when responding to people. This is one of my ugh fields – one of the areas in which I behave in a way that&#8217;s very impulsive, very &#8216;jerky&#8217;.

When we&#8217;re asking the question &#8220;how do I improve my life&#8221;, there are many different possible answers, many of which contradict one another, some of which are conditional on things that are uncertain, unclear and so on.

But I&#8217;m thinking that confronting ugh fields is one of the best ways to do it. It&#8217;s improving one&#8217;s life by cleaning up the toxic spaces, in a sense. It doesn&#8217;t presume to know what&#8217;s the right thing to do, how to allocate resources in a globally optimally way or anything like that. It&#8217;s just about removing things that trip you up.

So – one ugh field I&#8217;m happy to have conquered was involving food. I used to be terrified of handling food, probably because of some childhood hangups around mealtime and food preparation. But after I became an adult, this was a sort of really outdated, silly hangup that I had that didn&#8217;t make sense any more. So I decided that I was going to learn to cook. I&#8217;ve since learned to make pasta with minced meat, pan-fried stakes and chicken breasts and so on. I can do a pretty decent job of feeding myself with ingredients bought at a supermarket. But more importantly, I now have a sort of context in which I can continue to get better at cooking. I&#8217;m curious about buying better tools (pans, cutlery).

I&#8217;ve done the same thing with my fear of squats. I used to be strangely afraid of doing squats – mainly, I think because I was too tall to use squat racks as they are typically configured in local gyms, and I was ashamed to squat with just the bar, and I was worried that the form would be all wrong&#8230; all of those things. I got around it by literally buying my own squat rack so that I can squat at home.

So now that I&#8217;ve done it with both fitness and with food, it&#8217;s time to progress on to other things. One of it is to do with schedules and daily tracking. Accountability to self. I grew up being frustrated and terrified of timetables, bills, todo lists and tasks and so on, and so very often I just ignore those things as much as possible. I know it&#8217;s weird, but that&#8217;s just the nature of ugh fields and I have to accept that. To get past it I need to make them a highly-visible feature of my environment, and I need to make them a part of my daily routine. I think it&#8217;s especially important to carve out a substantial part of the weekend for myself every week to go through this. The next level would be to set aside time every single DAY to go through my stuff – I&#8217;m not sure why I haven&#8217;t been able to do that effectively yet, but maybe that&#8217;s just the nature of ugh fields. You need to be very strategic about it. It&#8217;s like a game of Heroes or Civilization or Starcraft – you gotta marshall your resources carefully. You have to concentrate your efforts, focus on the most important thing and get it knocked down. Secure a beachhead, and then move on bit by bit. You can&#8217;t just scattershot at everything.

The other thing is to practice meditation. Meditation often seems dull, or stupid, or a waste of time – just sitting there doing nothing. But it&#8217;s really about zooming out and getting a more global sense of perspective. It&#8217;s about getting removed from whatever situation is troubling you, at least inside your mind, and then you can see better, decide better. But meditation hasn&#8217;t quite caught on for me yet.

And now we get to what I started with, which is talking about how I deal with other people. My ugh field with other people – when people start talking to me about something, I very easily look at it through some sort of foreboding or intimidating lens. I get nervous for every single meeting that I go to, even 1-1s with my boss who I really enjoy, even though we&#8217;ve been doing this for almost 4 years. And this is a sort of global paranoia and anxiety that I have. I was going to say &#8220;low level&#8221;, but I have no real idea about what the actual level is. I want to address and resolve this anxiety and really make it my bitch. I think that&#8217;s doable, it&#8217;s just going to take a lot of smart, intelligent effort – because we&#8217;re talking about rewiring a brain that&#8217;s been wired a certain way for 20 years. So it&#8217;s got to be a sort of keyhole surgery, a very hard and deliberate approach..

I particularly want to stop freezing up when talking to people. I want to be warm and open and slow. I want to be able to take my time. I&#8217;m reminded now of my wife telling me how she saw me almost panicking when anxiously trying to get money to pay a pizza guy once. It&#8217;s like I was worried that he was going to get angry and scold me. Which is silly, because why would a pizza delivery guy scold me in any scenario, let alone one where I&#8217;m bigger and older than him? So there&#8217;s some sort of deep rooted shit there, and I need to meditate on that every day in order to change my perspective, in order to approach it differently.

That&#8217;s what I want for myself in 2017. I want to eliminate all the ugh fields that I can conceive of right now. Cook a great meal, have people over and relax in their presence, and go to meetings well-prepared without any sort of anxiety whatsoever. That&#8217;s what I want for now.
