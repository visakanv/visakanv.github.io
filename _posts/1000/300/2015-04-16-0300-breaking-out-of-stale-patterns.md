B: So the more interesting question to ask, I think, is why do you feel this way? Why do you constantly overestimate yourself? Why do you carry all this guilt and shame, that&#8217;s mostly imagined?

A: I suppose it must be serving some sort of self-interest. The saboteur-bum.

B: Do you find that metaphor useful for you?

A: Actually&#8230; not as much as I had hoped. I hoped it would&#8217;ve motivated me to defeat him. Instead&#8230; I find myself sort of using him to explain things. I&#8217;m being passive about it.

B: If you&#8217;re okay with it, then be okay with it.

A: I suppose&#8230; as long as I&#8217;m having difficulty sleeping at night and I don&#8217;t feel happy to be waking up in the morning, there is some sort of problem that I ought to address.

B: If you say so.

A: Yeah. I guess it&#8217;s this weird, twisted&#8230;

B: Not that weird. Not that twisted. It&#8217;s pretty normal. People like to come up with stories that make them feel like they didn&#8217;t have much of a choice. It allows you to give up, give in, surrender to fate. You just put up a socially acceptable amount of resistance– you whine and bitch as much as it takes– until you get tired, or until you feel like you&#8217;re justified, and then you go on living the same way, doing the same thing. You complain about drama, but really, you&#8217;re guilty of perpetuating it inside your own head.

A: You don&#8217;t have to put it that way&#8230;

B: No, I don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s a more polite way of describing it– if I figure it out I&#8217;ll let you know. But in the meantime– would you disagree?

A: I guess not. And I suppose that must be why I&#8217;m so exhausted in a psychological sense. Because I&#8217;m carrying a sort of double act. I was just telling some guy on Hacker News a while ago that that was his problem, too. That he was a fraud, because he claimed to be ambitious but admitted that he spent a lot of time vegging out online or in front of the TV. He described a gnawing feeling in his chest that I think I have too, and the reason I think I have that is because of the &#8220;complain about drama but perpetuate it anyway&#8221; situation you just described.

B: Right. Very good. You&#8217;ve got it figured out. But that&#8217;s the part you&#8217;re good at. The part you&#8217;re not so good at is following up. How are you going to followup here?

A: I&#8217;ve been using a phrase over and over again lately, which is self-flagellation. When I hear the word I think of those guys in the Philippines who literally flog themselves until I bleed, and I think about how overblown and ridiculous that is. They might get off on it psychologically somehow, and experience some sort of exalted high, but when I look at it I just see something that seems absurd. I hope by using the phrase and letting it sink into my subconscious, I&#8217;ll start to associate it with my own behavior. I self-flagellate too, only with my emotions and self-talk instead of a whip. But it&#8217;s equally absurd.

B: So what is the next step?

A: I guess the first thing is to put the whip down.

B: How do you do that?

A: Recognize when I&#8217;m doing it. Forgive myself. Blah blah. You&#8217;ve already heard this stuff.

B: Okay– what are we missing then? If you already know this stuff so well, why haven&#8217;t you implemented it?

A: That old bullshit about how knowing intellectually isn&#8217;t the same as knowing-by-doing. Knowledge is not techne, however you want to word it– you know what I mean. Dr. Russell Barker talked about this right? An ADHD person will know exactly what to do and yet not do it.

B: Well– why? You watched the talk. What did he say was the problem?

A: Something about&#8230; blah blah blah it doesn&#8217;t really matter. This is far more effort than it needs to be. All of this is just bad habits, old patterns. I just need to shake it off.

B: This sounds familiar. You&#8217;ve said this before.

A: I suppose I need to get into shorter and shorter cycles of actions. The longer time I spend between actions, the more I get into this stupid funk. I need to be aware in lots of little bursts. Hey, I restrung my guitar today. I did the dishes. I do all these little things. Spent the past few vomits talking about how it would be nice to go to the gym. Well, I should fucking go to the gym. Enough talking.

B: Sounds like you&#8217;re getting somewhere. But what&#8217;s going to stop you?

A: Nothing. I&#8217;m going to do it.

B: What&#8217;s different?

A: I guess it&#8217;s self talk. I guess it&#8217;s learning how to make the self-talk crescendo and modify the mood. Everything is a remix, right? And there are different streams of thought in my head, at different levels, different volumes. I need to bring some good things out of the mix, and put the bad things lower in the mix. These things will never go away but I need to take little actions. Hey, I&#8217;m doing these vomits and vomits are something, right? I&#8217;ve completed 30% of the journey that I set out for myself.

B: That&#8217;s good stuff, I&#8217;m proud of you for getting this far. You still have 70% to go.

A: Yup. And along the way I guess to move faster I need to work out. I need to stop mapping out the same map that I already having, and explore the uncharted territory. In this case it&#8217;s a very clear grey fog of war area between my house and my workplace and the gym. I don&#8217;t know how to get to the gym, even. I haven&#8217;t figured out what steps I need to take. And I know that when things are vague, they don&#8217;t happen.

B: So&#8230;

A: So I&#8217;m going to the gym. Bye. Will write more later.
