I will definitely sleep better tonight if I crank out a word vomit before I go to bed, so I think I ought to write one. But I&#8217;m not entirely sure what I should write about. I suppose I should look up my set of questions.

I wrote a letter to a young smoker in one of my last vomits, I think I also wanted to write a letter to someone else. 

Fuck man, I really want to write something that matters but it feels like nothing&#8217;s coming to me right now. There must be a reason why there&#8217;s nothing. There must be some sort of block. Let&#8217;s turn this into an exercise of confronting block, working around it, feeling for the block. What&#8217;s blocking me? What do I want to say that I&#8217;m not already saying? Do I want to talk about what I&#8217;m doing at work? Do I want to talk about my marriage? 

Yeah, I think when I&#8217;m blocked it&#8217;s usually because there&#8217;s something personal involved, something involving other people. That&#8217;s a cue for me to write something in private. But I don&#8217;t want to write something in private right now- I want to write something that I&#8217;m happy to publish. So I guess I&#8217;ll talk about my current status in thinking about productivity and efficiency. I&#8217;ve run through a lot of systems by now. I&#8217;ve tried pomodoro and pomotodo. I enjoyed the Pomodoro Challenge Timer (and I even paid for it), but I eventually stopped when I was missing some bits here and there and when I wanted to keep track of everything better- so I tried Pomotodo, which worked well for a while, but was giving me some other sort of trouble. I tried Beeminder for a while around vomits 90-something, but I got tired of all that data entry&#8230; it felt pretty tedious. I&#8217;m sure there would be a way to link up my wordpress publishing or something with all of that, but in the meantime all of that feels tedious.

I had a little mini epiphany of sorts a while ago where I realized that the thing that mattered most to me was to be able to trust myself. A lot of the grand epic things I try to do, or talk about doing, all of that might be my way of overcompensating for the fact that I used to be called lazy and lackadaisical and all that. I didn&#8217;t want to be that slacker bum, like that annoying &#8220;business partner&#8221; Tom Haverford had in Parks and Rec who didn&#8217;t want to do any work, who just wanted the glory of wannabe clever ideas. Gosh, what an annoying prick. I saw a bit of myself in him, which was really scary and painful.

So I have this magnificent boulder on my shoulder that I want to get rid of. [1] And I can only get rid of it by being disciplined and conscientious in service of myself, towards goals that I deem worthy. I think writing a million words will help me with that. 

So I guess I&#8217;ll just quickly talk about my approach to breaking down this boulder, and to learning to trust myself. How do I trust myself? I need concrete evidence, proof. I need to do things regularly, first little things and then add those little things up into bigger things. I have accomplished things at work, but it often feels like the failures exceed and outnumber the successes. I suppose they always will. Intellectually I can appreciate that, but I don&#8217;t like the idea of living a life in constant misery. 

Well it&#8217;s not CONSTANT misery, but I should be able to struggle and push myself without feeling like I&#8217;m always on the brink of bursting. Well- again, I&#8217;m never BURSTING, but I&#8217;m pretty sure the discomfort and frustration I feel isn&#8217;t a healthy, positive amount of frustration. I&#8217;m exerting myself a little too hard and a little not-smartly-enough. 

I&#8217;m like that guy at the gym lifting weights too heavy for him, with form that&#8217;s questionable. Injury is imminent if I&#8217;m not careful. And I suppose I actually do get &#8216;injured&#8217; in a sense, from time to time, and then that sidelines me and I can&#8217;t make any progress. And it perpetuates this narrative that I have in my head that I&#8217;ll never be fit, that I&#8217;ll never be healthy, that I&#8217;m doomed to this stupid miserable cycle and I should just try to find whatever pleasure I can, wherever I can, from mixed feelings park and from the dark playground. I don&#8217;t want that shit. It&#8217;s really sad and really shitty.

So I need to work on small bits- c&#8217;mon man we&#8217;ve been repeating this for 200,000 words now. I suppose the mini breakthrough is the realization that maybe online/digital apps and stuff don&#8217;t feel that great because they&#8217;re &#8220;illusory&#8221;, they don&#8217;t feel &#8220;real&#8221;. I&#8217;ve tried things like the X effect- it seemed to help me quit smoking, but I then tried to do it for 3 things at once- watch a video, meditate and reflect- and I couldn&#8217;t do all of those three things at once for 49 days in a row. Maybe I really gotta start with just one.

Anyway the thing I&#8217;m doing that I&#8217;m really excited about and have been keeping up with for i think a couple of weeks now is- I got one of those receipt impaling things from the local bookstore, and I&#8217;ve been writing my to-dos and tasks on post-its and little pieces of paper. When they get done, I fuckin&#8217; impale them. It&#8217;s very, very satisfying. I think as a habit it&#8217;s going to stick. I&#8217;m eagerly looking forward to filling the tower to the brim.

[1] As I write this I realize- the boulder seems to simultaneously exist and not exist, depending on whether I&#8217;m thinking about it or not. It goes in and out of focus. I can distract myself and avoid thinking about it. I can look away and- out of sight, out of mind. But I think it&#8217;s there. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s actually possible for me to live my life pretending it doesn&#8217;t exist until it doesn&#8217;t, because that limits my range of freedom, it limits the space I can navigate. 

What&#8217;s the real deal here? I suppose it&#8217;s just a part of my brain, a part of the landscape/city that is my mind, my life. And if I wanted to I could spend a lifetime avoiding it. But that would be an impoverished life, a limited life, and it seems like there are all sorts of costs to that, just as there are costs to letting part of a city fester and rot. You have to hold your nose everytime you walk past it, have to ignore the pain and suffering.
