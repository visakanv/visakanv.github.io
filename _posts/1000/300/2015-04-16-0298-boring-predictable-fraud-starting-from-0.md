A: People are boring and predictable.

B: Why, how boring and predictable of you.

A: I KNOW. It bothers me. I don&#8217;t want to be guilty of the very thing that bothers me. And the fact that I AM bothers me even more.

B: What makes you say that people are boring and unpredictable?

A: I don&#8217;t know. I look around and nothing is interesting. I know that I&#8217;m not the first person to say this, I know that lots of people have said this sort of thing over the years in many different contexts. What I want to know is what I ought to do about it.

B: Well, what do you think you ought to do about it?

A: I think&#8230; other people are usually a mirror to ourselves. We see what we want to see– or we focus on what we&#8217;re concerned about, what we&#8217;re worried about, what bothers us.

B: So&#8230;.

A: I am boring and predictable.

B: I&#8217;m sure you already knew that.

A: Yes, but why does that bother me? What&#8217;s wrong with being boring and predictable?

B: I suppose it must get stale.

A: Yes. It feels like wasted opportunity. It feels like stasis. We&#8217;ve got an eternity to be in stasis after we&#8217;re dead, so why am I like this while I&#8217;m still alive? What will it take for me to truly live?

B: You know you&#8217;re probably never going to answer that question. Or rather, maybe, you&#8217;ll only truly live when you are able to let go of that question. You&#8217;re living in your head, constantly asking questions, and the questioning is kicking up a dust that prevents you from living, whatever that means.

A: Yeah. I suppose I should stop and look at the clouds for a while.

B: You should. They&#8217;re pretty beautiful.

\*they pause to look at the clouds\*

A: \*a while later\* So what then? What next?

B: It&#8217;s entirely up to you.

A: My original sentiment hasn&#8217;t changed. I still feel like I&#8217;m in a boring environment, and I&#8217;d like it to be more interesting. I recognize and acknowledge that &#8220;boring environment&#8221; is a function of the lens that I use to look at it, so I ought to change my lens. What do I need to change about my lens?

B: Well&#8230; you say that people are boring and predictable. What might be interesting and unpredictable about people?

A: That&#8217;s a good question. I think&#8230; people get interesting and unpredictable, at least a little bit more so than usual, when you get them talking about themselves beyond the script.

B: How do you get people talking beyond the script?

A: I have some vague ideas but I&#8217;m not absolutely certain– if I were, I wouldn&#8217;t have this problem.

B: Let&#8217;s try it out. Do you think I&#8217;m boring and predictable?

A: Nope, you&#8217;re pretty smart.

B: What makes you say that?

A: You ask a lot of questions. You make me think and question things.

B: So&#8230;

A: So maybe what I need to do is ask more questions.

B: That seems like a fair course of action to take, yup.

A: Do you find ME boring?

B: \*tilts head\* I&#8230; never thought to think about that.

A: Doesn&#8217;t it bother you that you&#8217;ve never thought to think about that?

B: Not really. Like you said, boring is a function of the lens you use to view the world.

A: So what is your lens? How do you make sense of the world?

B: I&#8217;m not sure if I do. I just pay attention to whatever&#8217;s in front of me. In this case, right now, you.

A: What are you going to do afterwards?

B: Pay attention to whatever&#8217;s in front of me.

A: That sounds quite liberating, actually.

B: It is.

A: So what&#8217;s in front of me right now?

B: This conversation we&#8217;re having. We&#8217;re getting a little meta here.

A: I think meta-conversations can be interesting, but sometimes it&#8217;s also a bit of a copout. We go meta as quickly as we can and that makes us feel like the issues we were trying to address never got around to being addressed.

B: Sure. So what&#8217;s the issue here?

A: I have some sort of itch or desire that&#8217;s being unmet.

B: Describe it.

A: I want to be surprised. I want to be delighted. I want to be excited. I want to be in awe.

B: Those are nice things. What do you have to do to get those things done?

A: I have to change my behavior. I have to do something I&#8217;ve never done before. I&#8217;ve to get into environments that I&#8217;ve never gotten into before.

B: What would you like to do, where would you like to go?

A: I&#8217;d like to make YouTube videos, for some reason. I feel like that&#8217;s a whole world I haven&#8217;t explored. I&#8217;d like to go to the gym, but I haven&#8217;t figured out the logistics of going to the gym near my place. And if things aren&#8217;t clear, I don&#8217;t do them. Finally, I&#8217;d like to get all my work done, but for some reason I&#8217;m finding that really hard.

B: The videos, do them. The gym, figure out the logistics. What&#8217;s stopping you from doing your work?

A: I suppose it&#8217;s a kind of fear, uncertainty, doubt.

B: What are you afraid of, what are you uncertain of, what are you doubtful of?

A: I&#8217;m afraid that things will be crappy. I&#8217;m uncertain of whether any of this makes a difference. I&#8217;m doubtful that I can consistently deliver great value.

B: Okay. What&#8217;s wrong with crappy? What difference do you want to make? Why do you doubt your own consistency?

A: People will laugh at me, or realize I&#8217;m a fraud. I want to be an asset, not a liability, so I can be happy and comfortable– not necessarily exhilarated and indulgent, just not-worried and not-anxious. And&#8230; I&#8217;ve never been consistent before, so I have a lot of reason to doubt my own consistency.

B: Let&#8217;s try this. You are a fraud. Ha ha ha. Fraud. You are a liability. And you will never be consistent, ever.

A: That&#8217;s&#8230; hm.

B: Hm?

A: I won&#8217;t stand for that.

B: Why not?

A: Because this is my life and I don&#8217;t have to be those things if I don&#8217;t like them.

B: Yup. So&#8230;

A: So I start from zero.

B: Yup.
