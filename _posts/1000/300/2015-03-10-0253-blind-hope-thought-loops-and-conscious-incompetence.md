Blind hope is a dangerous thing. It makes me believe that tomorrow will be better without me doing anything about it. The most important thing really is that I focus on executing whatever I can do today, right now to improve my own life.

Right now I&#8217;m tired as heck- probably due to lack of exercise following my little illness episode. I slept 10 hours last night. Still tired. I&#8217;m cramped into a crowded rush hour train with a lot of tired, weary people. I have a lot of overdue tasks I have yet to complete.

But I&#8217;m trying to fight back against all of that. Putting on some aggressive music. Trying to write a vomit that I can publish when I get home. Then I&#8217;ll go for a run. And I&#8217;ll sleep well tonight. And wake up early tomorrow. That&#8217;s the plan- it starts with me finishing this vomit instead of scrolling through Twitter or other distractions.

So I suppose the topic here is self-regulation. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to do right now. I&#8217;m trying to take control of myself and do things that I say I want to do. I&#8217;m used to coming up with a big impressive list of things that don&#8217;t really get done- and then coming up with really good, valid excuses for why those things didn&#8217;t get done. Now I&#8217;m getting good at describing that series of events and ending with an uplifting things-are-gonna-get-better message. That&#8217;s all touching and sweet, but what I need to get good next is a lot more succinct- I need to quickly identify what needs doing and then quickly do it. I&#8217;ve been sitting around experimenting with meditation and thought experiments and it gives me this nice fuzzy feelings&#8230; I haven&#8217;t yet reached nirvana. Any moment now. But even that feels like this very longwinded way of trying to confront my problems.

There&#8217;s a funny intellectual question that gets raised- when I finally get around to solving my problems, does it happen because I exhausted all the alternatives? Does it happen because all my preparatory attempts, well, prepared me to get shit done? Or does it just happen from raw number-of-attempts? I do not know, because I&#8217;d I already knew then I would know more clearly what I should be doing.

When it all boils down to it, what makes a person take action? Why does someone finally quit, finally take the leap, finally publish, ship? How much awareness do they actually need? How much support, reassurance, belief? I still feel deep down that something is being hidden from me about the secret of driven, motivated human beings. And I&#8217;ve done the reading. I&#8217;ve watched the videos and pep talks- repeatedly! I take notes. I&#8217;ve tried to follow the steps, often stumbling and failing. I suppose I should just keep trying. It&#8217;s just so agonisingly slow. Behavioral change. I suppose I should write down why I&#8217;m doing what I&#8217;m doing. Why I care. Why things matter to me. I haven&#8217;t modified my environment as much as I can- that is, to remind me of what I want.

But why all these reminders? If you need that much reminding, is it really something you should be doing? Frankly I have no fucking idea and I&#8217;m tired of pretending. I&#8217;m tired of trying to hold everything inside my head. I&#8217;m giving up on a lot of things and putting my faith in this practice. I believe that if I just keep writing, even if I sometimes get stuck in certain loops or patterns, at the end of it I will have learned something. I would have changed somehow, and I would have developed a habit that serves me well.

I&#8217;ve had this recurring thought lately that I&#8217;ve been writing myself into a very neurotic state, thinking myself into a very neurotic state– by neurotic I mean a sort of anxious, sketchy state. I keep getting stuck in these little patterns or loops where everything feels very pointless and redundant. And then I get very doubtful of my ability to do anything, understand anything. What progress have I made, if it seems that I&#8217;m just questioning more things than ever, uncertain of more things than ever? I&#8217;m still missing appointments and deadlines.

But as I write this I realize that this must be the transition from unconscious incompetence to conscious incompetence– I&#8217;m developing a better understanding of what I THOUGHT I understood, but actually do not understand. This is painful to confront, but it&#8217;s ultimately liberating. I can start over from first principles and ask myself &#8220;What do I know for sure?&#8221;, and I know where not to go. I know what doesn&#8217;t work. The quote that comes to mind is– I haven&#8217;t failed, I&#8217;ve discovered a whole bunch of ways that don&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s important. It&#8217;s painful but I have to have faith that it&#8217;s progress.

I HAVE to? Not necessarily. I don&#8217;t have to do anything. But I do know that sort of giving up and being lackadaisical about it is unfulfilling. I&#8217;m feeling a bit of guilt for having to take so many words to get to this point, but FUCK IT I have committed myself to this process and I will see it to the end. If nothing else, I&#8217;ll develop a more nuanced appreciation for words, sentences, phrasing. I ought to remind myself of that– (yes, more reminders– because I forget things, and I overthink, and this might be suboptimal but gosh-darn-it I&#8217;m doing it anyway). Remind myself that these vomits don&#8217;t have to accomplish anything, they don&#8217;t have to take me anywhere, win me any accolades, impress anybody. No. These vomits exist for their own sake. I&#8217;m writing them because I am a person who enjoys writing, and I believe that the more I write, the happier I&#8217;ll be. The better I&#8217;ll be. The more in control I&#8217;ll be. The more I&#8217;ll grow and learn. And this process might be painful and messy and I&#8217;m going to repeat myself. I might be writing the same vomit 700 times in a row. Maybe that is what&#8217;s necessary. So Be It. I&#8217;ll do it.
