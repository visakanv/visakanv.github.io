Several times in my writing I have told myself that I want to improve my environment. I wrote in an earlier vomit– before I got married, before I seriously even considered the possibility that I would be a homeowner– that I would curate my living spaces and work spaces in ways that inspired me, that motivated me.

What have I done since? Not much. Why not? I think it&#8217;s largely because&#8230; I&#8217;m a little afraid of what other people would think. What my colleagues would think at work, what my wife and tenant would think at home. I know, it&#8217;s kinda silly. But I was self-conscious at home when I was a kid (again this is odd&#8230; it&#8217;s not like my parents ever stopped me). I guess I used to curate things online, have websites and folders and pages and all those things– but I never got around to literally modifying my physical environments.

So I thought I&#8217;d take a while to think about the improvements I could make to my spaces.

At home?

I keep forgetting that my home is MINE, and that I can do whatever I want with it. As long as my wife is okay with it, which I can check quickly by just asking her. If it&#8217;s something simple and reversible, I can just do it first and take it down if she doesn&#8217;t like it. But this uncertainty has been making me Not-Act.

In my bedroom?

I want to make sure that I know what I&#8217;m reading before I go to bed. This is pleasurable bedtime reading rather than calculated, hard-thinking/heavy reading. I should also include something maybe that&#8217;s some sort of incentive for me to get up early and go for a run. Maybe I could just have a running task– if I get up early and run in the morning, that gets to be a task in itself. Actually there&#8217;s no reason why it isn&#8217;t already– it IS! So why doesn&#8217;t it inspire me? I guess because it&#8217;s not immediate. Maybe I should bring my spindle to my room, and then skewer &#8220;jump out of bed&#8221; once I&#8217;m awake. I&#8217;ll give that a shot.

In my living room?

I like the post its and the calendar i&#8217;m currently using. I suppose I&#8217;d like something next to my calendar that has a picture of my entire life– I have that life-summary thing in my workflowy, but it&#8217;s too buried to make a difference. Even seeing it on my desktop I feel wouldn&#8217;t make that much of a difference&#8230; I think it&#8217;s more important to see it in between things. (Number of weeks left, number of hours, etc etc).

I guess I&#8217;d also like some inspiring visual, some inspiring quotes. Some stuff from MateusZ&#8217;s quotes of Les Brown, etc.

I should break down my existing post-its into things with more constituent-y tasks– right now some of them are overly broad, like &#8220;learn to make salad&#8221;. What do I need to do to learn to make salad? I need to break things into those littler details, because otherwise they&#8217;re never going to get done.

In my kitchen?

I suppose I could have some sort of plan or plans for the things that I&#8217;d like to cook. Maybe a list of recipes so I feel less intimidated. Maybe just a couple so I look at them whenever I walk past. Recipes/instructions on the fridge? I just need to see the process over and over again so it sticks, that&#8217;s all.

In my study?

I&#8217;m loving my spindle, which is the thing that I skewer my post-its and tasks on when I&#8217;m done with them. I think I also need to heavily curate the books on my shelves- I have far too many books that I&#8217;m not all that excited about reading. I should talk to my wife about this and see what she thinks. I should create a task to go through this vomit again and see all of the things that need doing– I&#8217;m going to create it right after I&#8217;m done with this.

At work?

I definitely feel like my entire team under-utilizes the actual physical space that we&#8217;re in– although this is probably me overreacting and exaggerating, because I have a taste for drama that way. But the most important thing is that I start with myself. That I externalize my own process. That I do really MVP versions of the things I think ought to be done– the reviews were a great idea. Should also do complaints! Will just do them first and see what people say.

At my desk?

Currently I have a few too many things, I&#8217;m sure. I have a couple of books. Maybe I should leave the Godin book open. The phone books are slightly annoying, I wonder if there&#8217;s a better solution? Maybe boxes.

Behind me?

I could totally use that space to do a lot of post-it stuff, but I&#8217;m not even sure about what I want to do there yet. It&#8217;s not really a calendar thing.

My monitor?

I should use this to remind myself about correspondence. I can use postits and I just should. They work. I should maybe use postits on my monitor at home too.

In front of me?

What do I need in order to work better? I most need to be reminded to follow a process, to plan, to commit, to be specific, and to follow through. I&#8217;m still overly vague about everything. The single most important thing that needs to happen right now is: that I write down my processes. What are &#8220;my processes&#8221;? I need to define that statement more clearly. I could probably do my next vomit about the process of making things more precise, turning vague goals into smart measurable bla bla goals.

Elsewhere in the office?

I&#8217;ll just make little suggestions when they occur to me.

On my phone?

I reformatted it recently. I should still kill more apps. And&#8230; I should use my calendar more. Why am I not currently using it? I suppose I don&#8217;t have a clear-cut phone routine. The empty page isn&#8217;t helping, it&#8217;s just&#8230; yeah. It&#8217;s a clusterfuck. I need to figure out what is optimum, and I think the optimum thing is that 1- I use it for calendaring my day,

On my Mac?

I sorted out my photos, which was a good first start. I still need to sort out my workflowy better.

In my notebooks?

On my browser?

Happy to have AdBlock, RescueTime which I don&#8217;t really use but can look at if I need to.
