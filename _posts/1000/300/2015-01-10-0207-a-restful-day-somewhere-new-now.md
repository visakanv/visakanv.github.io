Today was a good day, and one that I need to replicate a lot. It was simple and straightforward. I slept fully until I was ready to get out of bed- a little longer than that, actually. Then I did some small chores. Then I cooked breakfast with my wife&#8217;s help- beans, tomatoes, spinach and eggs. It was healthy, fresh and yummy. Then we watched a little bit of [Connections by James Burke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91XWKv5UuCM), chatted a bit, and then we napped again.

We each slept 3 hours. Then I woke up and [transcribed](http://visakanv.com/marketing/ev) (imperfectly) a talk by Ev Williams. I then watched a talk by Anita Sarkeesian at the same event. Then I chatted with my wife for a while, and then I washed the dishes while she made dinner– chicken, pasta and salad. Then I took another nap. (I&#8217;ve been very sleep deprived lately, so all this napping has been great for me.) Then we went for a walk. We had some ice cream, and then we had some prata, and then we walked more, and now we&#8217;re home. It&#8217;s 1am, and I feel the urge to crank out another word vomit before I go to bed.

Where am I? I was thinking a while ago- not sure if I wrote this down- that there&#8217;s an inwards journey that&#8217;s almost independent of journeying through time and/or space. I experienced this most strongly when I was in the shower after an early morning run. I experienced something akin to what Louis CK described when he was talking about when he discarded his old jokes and tried something a little strange and new. &#8220;I&#8217;m somewhere new now&#8221;, he [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R37zkizucPU). I last felt this way about quitting smoking, and again when I quit social media. And I experienced that when I was in the shower. I looked at myself in the mirror, and thought, &#8220;I&#8217;m somewhere new now.&#8221;

I think it&#8217;s interesting to deconstruct that. I wasn&#8217;t somewhere new physically, and I hadn&#8217;t been anywhere new physically. I had gone downstairs, I had travelled a short line and a circle or two, and then I had come back, and I was in the shower. None of that was anything new. I was up at maybe 7am, which was unusual for my circumstances, but again, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve never been awake at 7am in my life. I guess what was new was the fact that I had voluntarily woken up and left the house with the intention of going for a run, without any direct, extrinsic force acting on me. I was doing it because I wanted to do it. Which was new.

And I realize- or I got reminded of, rather- that there&#8217;s a choice that I get to make at every moment of every day. I get to do things as I&#8217;ve always done them, or I get to do things differently. One of the problems is that the [fog](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html) tends to stop me from even realizing that I have a choice. It just keeps me running on autopilot. Why do I do that? Why don&#8217;t I do things differently?

The short answers aren&#8217;t all that interesting, though they&#8217;re true- as a human being I&#8217;m wired to do whatever&#8217;s simple and convenient, I&#8217;m wired to have habits. There&#8217;s no real survival-affecting reason why I should put in more effort to change the way I do things. (A quote that really stood out for me- can&#8217;t remember where I read it- was that humans aren&#8217;t evolved to be happy. Happy people don&#8217;t survive better than angry, anxious, nervous, paranoid people.)

But okay. I also have this problem where I over complicate things. What I really need to do is create more spaces for myself to make better decisions, rather than agonize over how shitty my decisions are when I&#8217;m tired and frustrated and overwhelmed. Turned out what I needed was some meditation (5-10 minutes can make a big difference), some naps (20 mins here, 20 mins there, again huge difference), healthier food (oh my god you have no idea), a couple of cabs to avoid shitty commutes (this costs $$– I&#8217;m not rich, but I can afford to spend a bit more than usual if it means better mental health), and some exercise (I just jog quickly to the nearby fitness corner and sprint as quickly as I can for a couple of rounds.)

Doing those things have greatly reduced the anxiety that was plaguing for quite a while. The source of my anxiety was my own inefficiency at work. I was hoping that I would&#8217;ve become effective at work because I quit smoking and I quit social media, the latter of which was a huge time sink. Surely if I had more time, I would be more efficient? Turns out that the answer is no. I just spend more time doing unnecessary research, and I spend more time trying to do impossible things at the expense of things that ought to be done.

I was talking to my content team and realizing that when I encounter something, a starting point, I tend to have a vision of version 999 that develops. And I tend to get a clearer and clearer sense of what that optimal, perfect case would look like. What I&#8217;m really, really bad at doing is figuring out what version 1 should be, and versions 2 through 10. I really ought to just ship a series of version 10s- and that&#8217;s how I ultimately get to version 999 of anything. What&#8217;s instead been happening is that I fixate on version 999, try to do it all at once, and I just get overwhelmed and I hate myself. I bite off more than I can chew. And this reduces my Expectancy of what can and cannot be done.

So this year I want to change all that. This year is the year of version 1s and version 10s instead of version 999. I&#8217;m going to ship lots of little shitty things and be okay with that. The hardest part, really, is prioritizing what&#8217;s the bare minimum necessary for something to function effectively. Turns out that a lot of the time, I don&#8217;t actually know. I think this might be the most important skill I have to develop. (Incidentally, the next most important thing is that I publish this vomit and go to bed, so goodnight.)
