I just woke up from a shitty dream. I&#8217;m not sure how it started (dreams usually begin in the middle, right?) but involved me having to re-take examinations that I had flunked. I retook my&#8230; PSLE, I believe? And maybe did well. I remember getting into a cab and going to my secondary school again, maybe to ask if they&#8217;ll take me back. I&#8217;m not sure why I was retaking my PSLE. I remember thinking- I did well for E-maths but poorly for A-maths the last time, and even if I do well for A maths this time I&#8217;m going to have some trouble with H2 maths for my A levels- and I&#8217;m married and I have a house and I have bills to pay and I don&#8217;t have time to do all these things, to get all these things right. I felt like an absolute failure, like I was wasting all this time and everybody&#8217;s money and resources and it just felt really, really horrible. I woke up almost in tears.

Pause.

Now I find myself thinking- why? Why does this keep happening? Why is this such a big deal to me? And I&#8217;m reminded of another conversation I had with somebody about how- for the longest time I thought none of this mattered to me. I didn&#8217;t think it was an issue for me, I thought I had successfully ignored it, avoided it, not cared about it. But it turns out that underneath it all I do care. I actually care about a lot of things very deeply. Most things, even.

There&#8217;s this thing happening in my neighbourhood right now where a Resident&#8217;s Committee is surveying people about whether they&#8217;d like their community cats &#8220;removed&#8221;. What the actual fuck. We&#8217;re such disgusting human beings. And then I zoom out and remind myself that that&#8217;s just one thing that&#8217;s happening. There are literally millions of such despicable things happening everyday- people getting raped, murdered, tortured, battered, abused, all sorts of horrible devastation. And I&#8217;m never going to be able to put a dent in any of that. All I can do is focus on my own circle of control/influence and seek to expand that, so I can at least maybe make some people better off by a little bit before I die, and before we all return to sand and become nothing in the heat death of the universe.

Pause.

Maybe that&#8217;s projecting too far. I don&#8217;t know. I can&#8217;t know. All I can know and work on is me. And I think I&#8217;ve worked myself into a bit of a cramp, and I need to uncramp myself with meditation and breathing and relaxation and warm showers. I need to realize that it&#8217;s okay to fail, and that it&#8217;s okay for the whole thing to fall apart, because everything does fall apart in the end, and yet I need to put in the effort to get things right. I need to focus and prioritize and manage my time, work backwards, do first things first, be proactive, realize the distinction between productive and busy, yadda yadda. I&#8217;m faking it till I make it, and I do believe that I&#8217;ll make it eventually. I just seem to have this need right now at this moment to wallow in a sort of self-pity and self-disgust and I&#8217;d like to get over that pretty quickly if I may, please.

Pause.

I didn&#8217;t take any vacation days this year. I don&#8217;t mean that as some sort of brag. That&#8217;s just stupid and self-damaging. It&#8217;s really failure of prioritization and self-management on my part. But I gotta let that go and let myself be okay with that. I can&#8217;t keep beating myself up over sunk costs. All of this is a manifestation of a disease that I can always, at any moment, take immediate steps to fix. It&#8217;s just that those steps are always the hardest, the most painful, the ugliest. It&#8217;s easy to bitch and whine and cry and hurt about how all of this is. I read somewhere about failure in silicon valley and how failure ain&#8217;t actually all that bad. I&#8217;m not being precise enough- by that I mean to say that it&#8217;s easier to lapse into drunkenness and to blow away all your money and to destroy your marriage than it is to sit down and fix things. And yeah I&#8217;m thoroughly aware of the alternate POVs and how sometimes you just need to let things go, sometimes it&#8217;s okayÂ to fail,

Pause.

Clearly that bunny trail is a clusterfuck that&#8217;s difficult to explore and clarify, because rationalization kicks it. The narrativistic bias kicks in. Explanation kicks in. And while that requires effort, it&#8217;s relatively easy, and it keeps you in that same space that you&#8217;re in. It finds you the most comfortable spot in the cave. The real challenge is to leave the cave. Or if the language of challenges and difficulty sounds overly self-flagellating, well, the real joy is to leave the cave. The real pleasure. The real happiness. If I want that I have to do the things that fix the problems that I have. Quitting smoking was part of it. Quitting social media was part of it. These things were unique to me, and may not necessarily apply to anybody else. I can and should learn from others but really I just need to do the most important work that&#8217;s in front of me, that I&#8217;m constantly putting off.

Pause.

I&#8217;m fine, really. All of this is just the messy midpoint before I burst forth with clarity, happiness and joy. I truly believe that. I truly believe that I&#8217;m coming out of a funk that I hadn&#8217;t quite realized for what it was. And that moving forward, I&#8217;m going to be more disciplined. I&#8217;m going to take charge of my life. I&#8217;m going to do first things first, and I&#8217;m going to work backwards from what matters. I&#8217;m going to be a lot smarter about things, and I&#8217;m going to change my strategies and the way I play. This is just a bit of a learning blip. I truly believe this. And I&#8217;m truly going to fix this. There is literally nothing more important.

&#8220;Take it easy, but take it.&#8221;
