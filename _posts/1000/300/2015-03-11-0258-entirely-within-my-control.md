I&#8217;m in bed right now and I feel strangely compelled to start and complete a word vomit before I go to bed. I don&#8217;t even have anything in mind to write about, so I guess this is one of the &#8220;true&#8221; stream-of-consciousness vomits.

Earlier today when I was at lunch with a couple of colleagues, I talked about my Xiaomi &#8220;Mi Fit&#8221; (basically a poor man&#8217;s FitBit/Jawbone) and how it was tracking my sleep– and I talked about how I find that when I sleep early and wake up early, I seem to have a lot more willpower and I make much better decisions. Yet that doesn&#8217;t happen very much, I said. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that entirely within your control,&#8221; my boss asked. That hit me pretty hard. It&#8217;s very silly of me to sit upon a realization for so long and not do very much about it. I&#8217;m just sort of wringing my hands and going, &#8220;Yeah, A is better than B. But I&#8217;ll just stick with B anyway. Because B is familiar, maybe. Even though I actually know for a fact that A is better. And that A makes my life better.&#8221;

Isn&#8217;t that strange? It&#8217;s literally impossible to explain&#8230; the amount of effort I would have to take to try and rationalize that one is effort better spent trying to change and revise the habit. So I&#8217;m doing that. I&#8217;m going to sleep right after I finish writing this.

A couple of vomits ago I wrote about the importance of having daily reviews. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve written about that many, many times– and again I&#8217;m sorta curious about how many times I&#8217;ve written about it, but I&#8217;m not nearly as curious about that as I am about finding out what my life will become like if I do those daily reviews. So I just did one earlier– and the very act of writing it down made me feel compelled to go and finish one more task that I had left hanging. So that&#8217;s done.

The next thing then is to do the review again tomorrow. And the day after. I suppose at some point I&#8217;ll even add a planning segment to the reviews, where I think about what I want to do the next day. But that&#8217;s over-planning for now, and adding too much complexity. I have to get this super simple thing done. I&#8217;ve started using this little moleskine book that I&#8217;ve had for a while but didn&#8217;t find any use for. It&#8217;s thin, it&#8217;s pretty and I can keep it by my bed. I should be able to remember to write in it before I go to bed everyday, and I&#8217;m keeping it where I charge my phone. (What would be awesome would be if I&#8217;m not able to charge my phone until I&#8217;ve done the review. That would be awesome.)

I&#8217;ve been doing more thinking-about-meditation (though perhaps not enough meditation). Just a sort of broad, reflective sort of thinking. I stopped to take a walk today around the block– something I do sometimes– and I did it with the lens of &#8220;do this like it&#8217;s the last thing you&#8217;ll ever do.&#8221; And in a sense it is, isn&#8217;t it? Everything is the last thing you&#8217;ll ever do in that moment. You might do something similar later on, but in that particular moment that is entirely how you&#8217;re going to spend that brief gift of time. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to ever be sloppy in practice, or ever to be sloppy in anything, really. If you act, act hard. If you rest, rest fully. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to do things in a half-hearted way. And yet I do&#8230; seemingly because of unenlightened legacy processes.

Maybe that answers the earlier question. I don&#8217;t like taking responsibility for my life. I haven&#8217;t developed it– it&#8217;s an atrophy muscle. I haven&#8217;t yet learned to trust myself to take actions that benefit me, so I allow myself to fall into habits that do NOT benefit me- or even outright damage me. And as always, this sounds silly when I write it down. So I&#8217;m hoping that the act of writing it down regularly will help me internalize just how silly it is.

If I do nothing else with these vomits but remind myself that I want to live life fully, to embrace rather than reject or deny the present moment, I think I would&#8217;ve done well. In these spaces I create the beginnings of the sparks that will turn into the flame of lightness and awareness that will consume my life. And I will take back this world that I have given away to forces beyond my control. I will greet at the door the stranger that is myself, and I will feast on my life. That&#8217;s the plan. And that&#8217;s the doing, the being, right now.

Yeah, cheesy language I know. But I think it&#8217;s true. I think I&#8217;ve caught tantalizing little glimpses of what it might be like to live life without fear, without anxiety. To pay attention– not as a fine, not as punishment for being a lousy human being, but because attention is a gift worth lavishing on every single facet of being.

What of prioritization? I suppose I can&#8217;t even begin to think about prioritization if I&#8217;m not even here. Only when I&#8217;m here do I have the luxury and privilege of scanning through my environment, scanning my own body, scanning my own mind and discovering what the most important thing is. And then I can do that. As Marcus Aurelius put it, if I concentrate at each minute on what&#8217;s in front of me, and I act upon it with tenderness, with justice, and I put away distractions and I focus, then I&#8217;ll find in fact that I don&#8217;t actually need to do everything. There are actually just a few things that need to be done in life– it&#8217;s just that they need to be done well. There&#8217;s an elegance in that that&#8217;s eluding me right now, but I am determined to grasp it– or rather, to embody it, because it&#8217;s not something you grasp.
