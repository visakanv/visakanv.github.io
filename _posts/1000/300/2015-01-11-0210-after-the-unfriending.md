Since [unfriending everybody](http://visakanv.com/1000/0191-i-unfriended-everybody/ "0191 – I Unfriended Everybody"), I&#8217;ve gotten quite a bit more headspace to think about other things.

It&#8217;s been lonely, I have to admit. I&#8217;ve been very isolated for the past year. The only human contact I have is with my wife at home and with my colleagues at work. I stopped hanging out with old friends (partially a geographic issue- I was no longer where all my old friends were, and I have no close friends who live where I moved to). I unfollowed and unfriended everybody on Twitter and Facebook, and I deleted as many accounts as I could. And then I went on a sort of radio silence.

I did this because I wanted to know who I was away from all of that noise. I had become really good at responding and replying to other people&#8217;s statuses and updates, and I was keeping track of lots of people&#8217;s lives, whether intentionally or otherwise. RescueTime told me that I was spending 3-5 hours a day on social media, sometimes more. I was feeling &#8216;stuck&#8217; at work and with my personal projects, so I felt like it would make a lot of sense to just let go of the 3-5 hours altogether.

I was a little afraid to do it, but I decided that it didn&#8217;t make sense to live in fear of what people might think. Why stay friends with people who get so easily offended at you leaving a space, especially if you felt it was necessary for your emotional and psychological well-being? I wanted to know who my real friends were. I wanted to know who would reach out to me if I were gone, who would notice if I were missing.

Initially it was a little daunting, and I started by unfollowing people that I never had any contact with, no real conversations, no real discussions. Then I unfollowed the people who I felt were a little toxic for me- people with whom my interactions were rather combative, forceful, argumentative, etc. I then started gathering momentum, and I decided to unfriend even my close friends and colleagues, people I cared very much about. I unfollowed everybody. And then suddenly, all was quiet.

It was simultaneously more and less than I expected. The quiet was palpable. I would still log into Facebook and Twitter out of habit and impulse, and see that there was nothing there to see. I would catch myself logging in again and again, and it would be clear that the habit had formed. And each time I would encounter nothingness, and that would be a cue for me to contemplate. How much I had grown dependent on these services to fill up my hours, to make me feel like I was doing something. Over time, I would spend less and less time on those platforms. I posted a couple of links to good reads– again, out of habit, and I&#8217;d find that nobody responded. And so it felt like I was losing the feedback that kept me going- those notifications, those little dings that kept me going. And so the whole thing started to sort of wilt and die out.

So, what do I do with all this extra headspace? I haven&#8217;t decided yet, actually. I feel like my mind has been very foggy and cluttered lately. But it&#8217;s not like these are new things. I&#8217;m just waking up to the mess that was here all along, that I was distracting myself from. And some of it has been scary and painful to face. But it feels really necessary. What am I talking about?

I guess– in the absence of peripheral peer approval- which I had gotten pretty good at getting- I wasn&#8217;t super clear about what I wanted. Or if I was clear, that clarity was fleeting- and maybe I&#8217;ll find bits and pieces of it when I review my writing.

Will I always be this total recluse? No, absolutely not. I can&#8217;t survive like this indefinitely. I definitely need human contact. But I guess I had approached the problem of &#8220;I need human contact&#8221; in a very inelegant, wanton, messy, unaesthetic, unimaginative way, with left me with all sorts of people that weren&#8217;t necessarily good for me. I hadn&#8217;t pruned and tended to my garden, and as a result I had a whole bunch of crap and mess and ugly that was painful and unsightly to deal with. So I burned the whole thing to the ground. And before I start again, I&#8217;m using this space to ruminate, to meditate, to reminisce. To figure out what really matters to me, what I really want out of the remainder of my days, what I really want out of my relationships.

What do I want? I want peers that I really respect and admire, and I want to become a person who those people admire. I want to be at the forefront of humanity (as I choose to define it- yeah, I know that life isn&#8217;t a competition, but I think some people are doing more amazing things than others, and I want to align myself with the people who are doing amazing things- because I think they have a better sense of reality, and they have more fun, and they&#8217;re just happier and more fun to be with, and they say and do more interesting things&#8230;)

I&#8217;m confident that I&#8217;ll get there if I just put in the work. I just need to keep putting in the work. I need to maintain a daily discipline. I need to manage my time better, have more output, prioritize things. I need to write more, and I need to focus on things that are worth writing about. But even that might be premature optimization. I need to trust myself and just do a little bit of writing everyday. Every single day. And I need to sleep early. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s not that complicated. I&#8217;ve been complicating things, kicking up a dust and then struggling to see. I think I&#8217;ve been doing all that kicking because I used to be such an inactive bum. I&#8217;ve been driving myself to blind overwork so that I can collapse from exhaustion rather than laziness, and learn from that point.

I think a part of it might be narrative, which even I&#8217;ve bought into without realizing or not. While I hate the idea of busywork, I think it&#8217;s easier to do too much busywork, burnout and then recover from that point&#8230; than it is to start out as a lazy bum and become effective from there. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m just validating my own narrative. We&#8217;ll see. Just putting this out there. It isn&#8217;t nearly as important as actually just getting the important work done.

Done.
