I&#8217;m literally sick, with a cough and a flu of some sort. It&#8217;s kind of odd that after 20++ years I still completely haven&#8217;t figured out what different kinds of sick are, and how I ought to deal with each piece of sick. All I know is that they incapacitate me in different ways, to different degrees, and that I&#8217;m generally bad at dealing with incapacitation.

So I&#8217;m sick, tired and weary and I feel like I haven&#8217;t really done anything good in a while. I suppose that might be another way of saying that I feel like I haven&#8217;t written in a while. I talked about this in my previous vomit when I was parroting Ray Bradbury– it seems like I&#8217;m lighter and happier when I&#8217;ve been writing. If I haven&#8217;t been writing, my whole being starts to get edgy&#8230; I start to feel like I&#8217;m getting &#8220;dirty&#8221;, even. Muddied up, unclear. I start wanting to pick fights, to argue with people. Which I know is kinda&#8230; selfish? It&#8217;s kind of jealous? It&#8217;s what happens when I feel like my world-view hasn&#8217;t been represented, validated.

Which is really narrow-minded, I guess. But it remains true that I feel pain and frustration, and it remains true that writing seems to alleviate that pain. I know that I want to become a better writer, and I know that practicing writing– whatever the hell it is I might be writing about– makes me a better writer.

Ergo, I need to revisit the simple idea that writing is therapy.

I think I make a mistake where I try too hard to plan my writing. I used to try to come up with grand ideas&#8230; these days I try to come up with plans and schedules, and in both cases I think I&#8217;m a little bit right, but also quite a bit wrong. (Right and wrong in the sense of– how should I approach this process? What is the best way to do it?)

Heh, feels like I&#8217;m not grammar-ing properlly. I&#8217;ll let that slide. That was an early principle of these vomits– the grammar is less important than me getting out what I feel like I want to say. And Bradbury pointed out that there is truth in quickness– when you go fast, you don&#8217;t have time to think so you say what is really there, even if you say it in a way that&#8217;s less than perfect. You can edit later.

Right, the right way of doing it. Writing should be a joy. It should be something that I&#8217;m excited about. The words should fly off my fingers. If they&#8217;re not flying, maybe I need to read a book, trigger some thoughts. Maybe I need to go for a run. But I have to stop pretending that I can store inspiration for later use. Inspiration, it seems, almost always needs to be acted on immediately or given up. And I try to hold on to it for far too long, and it wears me out. It&#8217;s like running after a runaway horse, hoping to climb upon it and domesticate it. If the horse is already past you, there&#8217;s no way in hell you&#8217;re going to catch up on foot! You should wait for the next horse. And as far as we can tell, we&#8217;re in a bloody stampede of sorts– there&#8217;s never going to be a shortage of horses! I just get fixated on the horse ahead of me and I get so upset when it seems like I&#8217;m going to lose it.

So this is me giving myself permission to lose horses. Life is too short and fleeting for me to obsess about horses that get away. If I just focus on the fundamentals, pay attention to the nuances of a given moment, I should be able to capture whatever it is that is coming at me.

Which isn&#8217;t to say that I&#8217;m going to discard all of my plans altogether. I still think it makes sense for me to work on old things and to find connections between things. What I should do instead I think is&#8230; I should have a ritual/routine where I get out my computer to write. I think I&#8217;ll walk into my study and go and write there. I think I&#8217;ll have a box which says &#8220;list of old ideas and thoughts about what to write&#8221;, which I DONT NECESSARILY HAVE TO OPEN. I think that&#8217;s the key. I think too often I feel like all my old ideas are a sort of obligation– just becuse I didn&#8217;t do my homework as a kid, I have to now do justice to each and every single piece of idea I&#8217;ve ever had. Just to close the loop on all of those things. I think I should be more okay with literally burning things. Burn it all to hell. Start over. I have to have faith in that process.

What am I writing for, though? I&#8217;ve been feeling a tinge of nihilism lately– that there&#8217;s no point to any of this, that we&#8217;re all going to die, and the universe is itself going to die, and it wil be all for naught, bla bla bla. I started listening to some Alan Watts and reading some Eckhart Toille looking for some sort of inspiration of salvation. I know that the sort of existential despair is ultimately BORING, which is why I&#8217;m confident that I won&#8217;t linger in it for too long. Life is a gift and an opportunity, even if it isn&#8217;t necessarily part of some ultimate meaning or anything like that. 

I suppose it&#8217;s more interesting to think about why I think what I think, why I worry about what I worry. A lot of it seems to be some sort of defense mechanism. I&#8217;m reaching the end of 1000 words in this one pretty soon, and I&#8217;m going to do a thing where I try to wrap this up and then start my next thought in another vomit. Because it feels like that will do me good.
