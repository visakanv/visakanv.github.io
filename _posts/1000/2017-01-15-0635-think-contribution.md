I want to spend this vomit thinking about the contributions I want to make. I&#8217;m approaching the two-thirds mark (666 word vomits), so I think I need to start thinking about &#8216;life after the vomits&#8217;.

One thing I&#8217;ve been feeling strongly about quite recently is that I need to own a blog that&#8217;s focused on a niche that I care about, that _isn&#8217;t_ based on my primary domain name (visakanv.com). I&#8217;ve already bought a domain, but I&#8217;m not going to talk about it directly on this blog right now until I&#8217;ve made something of it. I have some goals – I want to publish about 100 posts, do some promotion, build some relationships anonymously, get the backlinks and so on. This actually feels like some weight off my shoulders, because I can simplify what I do on my primary site.

I&#8217;m going to simplify visakanv.com – I want to make it very easy for anybody Googling for me to get a simple, clear picture of who I am and what I do, and get links to my absolute best work. I also have a memoir project that I want to do.

I&#8217;m going to take everything Singapore related and move it to visakanv.com/sg/. Over there I&#8217;m going to split things according to topical iss ues. National Service. The education system and the pressure-cooker atmosphere around it. The issue of censorship, especially how mindlessly it&#8217;s done. Addressing things like how sterile and stodgy the country supposedly is. I find myself thinking about what the news has been like in the past decade that I&#8217;ve been observing it, and how there are all these recurring patterns. I find myself thinking about what I saw on slatestarcodex – a joke about having a schedule for arguments – in January we&#8217;ll argue about this, in February we&#8217;ll argue about that, and so on. I find myself thinking&#8230; maybe that might be something worth doing? Yes, actually. I think I&#8217;ll that. It&#8217;s already halfway through January&#8230; but let&#8217;s just go for it anyway.

What else? I also have many book reviews that I want to get through, and TV show reviews, movie reviews, product reviews. So how do I prioritize? Which goes first? Should I put one of the projects (reviews vs SG) on the backburner, or should I try to do both? And I also have the project I talked about earlier on. And I have this word vomit project as well. Typing all this out, it becomes pretty clear that I have a little too many things to do all at once – I also have to work on my job – which is not just a time-pass for me; it&#8217;s important to me that I get my work done well and continue to develop myself in my career. That&#8217;s a lot of things to do. How am I going to do all of it? What&#8217;s my top priority? Right now, my top priority is to publish this word vomit. After that, my next top priority is work – I&#8217;m getting paid for it, and my professional reputation is tied up in it, but I think most importantly I feel gratitude to and affection for my team, and I want to contribute in that way so that I can do more for that.

Oh yeah, pause – and I have my marketing blog too, which is an overlap between what I do at work and what I want to talk about in public about marketing, advertising and so on. Let&#8217;s list these out again for clarity&#8217;s sake–

  * visakanv.com – the nexus from which everything else comes out of; a list of my best and favorite essays
  * visakanv.com/blog/ – I&#8217;m going to have content about storytelling, about writing, about book reviews, product reviews and so on.
  * visakanv.com/sg/ – to write things that contribute to discourse in Singapore, encouraging people to think more critically, to try and transcend above us-vs-them dynamics and think about what&#8217;s best for Singapore in the long term
  * visakanv.com/marketing/ – to share my experience, insights and learnings as a SaaS content marketer over the past 4 years
  * visakanv.com/1000/ – the writing project that I&#8217;m working on here. Lots of the content here will be repurposed for other sites
  * ???.com [to be revealed later] – a blog about productivity, GTD, procrastination, fitness, health

That&#8217;s a lot of stuff. It seems like a lot of stuff. I will have to prioritize. I think my biggest priority actually is still going to be the /1000/ project – I want to finish this and get it out of my system. I guess I&#8217;m going to write on the wall&#8230; okay. I just took a few minutes to write down all of the above on postits that go on my whiteboard in the study so that I can look at them every day. [1]

[1] Which got me thinking now – what else should go on my whiteboard? What should come down from it? I have a few reminders to self that I could turn into blogposts – I think it&#8217;s important to make sure that the entire whiteboard is constantly updated. Everything should be completely wiped off every so often, so that there&#8217;s an opportunity to start over from scratch. Otherwise I fall into the trap of having things just become a little too familiar, and I don&#8217;t really pay attention to them. This is not good. This is not what I want. I want things to get addressed, taken care of. I want them to be resolved. I want things to go from my Whiteboard (which is where things are played around with in an experimental, generative sort of stage) to my Things (mac app – where I come up with physical next-action tasks to follow up on). And things should then either get done or Next&#8217;d or Someday&#8217;d, and I should just keep kicking butt at whatever&#8217;s on my list. And every week or so I should step back and go, is this helping me get to where I want to go? Do I need to revise where I want to go? I&#8217;m going to be a beast this year. I&#8217;m going to contribute like mad. Let&#8217;s do this.
