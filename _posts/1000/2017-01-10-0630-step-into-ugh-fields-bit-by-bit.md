Let&#8217;s pick up where we left off.

// Who did you have to be?

I had to be compliant enough to do as I was told, to follow along without asking questions, and yet smart enough and disciplined enough to do well academically. I was none of the above. The first 10 years or so of my life were pretty lovely, and I can&#8217;t complain about any of that. If I could&#8217;ve changed something, I would&#8217;ve tried to introduce a bit more of some sort of discipline, some rigor, habit, routine, experiment more with swimming, cooking, trying different things. But that&#8217;s not a complaint so much as a wish of sorts.

// Why are you blocked?

Like I said, I was neither compliant nor disciplined. I got really good at getting in my own way. I&#8217;m thinking now about how I&#8217;m capable of playing video games or watching movies for hours and hours long after everyone else is too tired to continue. I&#8217;m trying to channel that right now into my writing – I&#8217;m writing this word vomit at 2:47am when I ought to be sleeping.

That said, I&#8217;ve committed myself to writing a word vomit a day. So what I need to do, to avoid following in the footsteps of lesser men, is to avoid using the word vomit as an explanation for why I&#8217;m not sleeping. Sleeping early and sleeping well is one of my highest intended priorities. But to say &#8220;i&#8217;m not sleeping because I&#8217;m writing a word vomit&#8221; is myopic. Why didn&#8217;t I write the word vomit earlier? Because I was procrastinating. Because I was looking at random nonsense that wasn&#8217;t actually relevant to my main concerns in life. What was I doing? I was looking up random strangers on the Internet. A while before that I was going through my bookmarks – and yes, I did update my bookmarks very well, removing links that are no longer relevant, making existing links more parseable – I did make an hour or two of progress on that. But is that my top priority? No! My top priorities are – writing word vomits and sleeping early.

So the question is – why isn&#8217;t my behavior aligned with my priorities? And what do I need to do to close that gap? What are the possibilities?

One possibility is that my priorities aren&#8217;t my real priorities, they&#8217;re just goodfeels priorities. Escapist priorities. Like having grand, vague goals that can never be achieved.

The way to fix that is to make the priorities really precise. So I have – &#8220;publish one word vomit every day&#8221; and &#8220;sleep earlier and better&#8221;. I should replace that with &#8220;publish one word vomit as early as possible each day – first thing in the morning&#8221;, and &#8220;start preparing for sleep at 10pm and get in bed at 11pm every day unless there is an emergency&#8221;. I seem to have had some resistance to this for a while. I think because it seems boring and limiting in the short term. Like, why should I have to &#8216;limit&#8217; myself like that?

As I write this down, it&#8217;s obviously silly. It&#8217;s obvious intellectually that self-discipline, self-binding, commitment devices – these things bring more freedom. But it&#8217;s not so obvious in the short run. In the short run it just looks like pain and frustration, or boredom, or limitations – and it&#8217;s an &#8216;ugh field&#8217; for me. (At this point, I recalled that I once wrote a blogpost about ugh fields, and went looking for it – and funnily enough, the last time I thought about it, I was also writing a word vomit at 3:25am in the morning. It&#8217;s 3:02am now. I&#8217;ll be done in about 5 minutes or so, so at least I&#8217;m making some sort of progress, maybe. Who knows, everything is an illusion.)

Okay, so ugh fields. I need to walk into them. I need to walk into my fear and my discomfort. And I need to take pride in making myself a priority. Take pride in sleeping early because it gives me a clear mind to take on the world. Take pride in writing early because that&#8217;s one task done in the morning, one task gotten out of the way, and like Admiral McRaven says, that&#8217;s the beginning of a chain reaction. That allows me to do one more little thing, and one more.

What would I want to do next? I&#8217;ve learned by now that it&#8217;s not helpful for me to try and take on 20 things all at once the moment I feel like I want to be more productive. I have to do one thing first. So let&#8217;s say, right now, I finish this word vomit. Then I shower and go to bed. Then I wake up in the morning. I have to do another word vomit as early as I can. Once that is done it will be time to go through my todo list and then elaborate on each thing to turn it into a next action. And then it would be to clean out my email, and follow up on the things that I owe people. I need to make that a part of a daily routine that I really enjoy, and maybe tie it to something like a coffee or something pleasurable so that I really enjoy it. I wrote about this problem in 2015, and I&#8217;m writing about it again in 2017. I do NOT want to be writing about it in 2018 or 2019, so the buck stops here. I have been doing regular reviews of my days so far in Evernote – not every single day is perfectly captured, but the habit has been rolling over and it&#8217;s been good.

I&#8217;m serious about making this work. I really want it to work. I really want to get good at it. I&#8217;ve learned to cook for myself, at least a couple of dishes with a couple of different inputs. I&#8217;ve learned to squat and deadlift. I&#8217;ve bench pressed 60kg and more, which used to seem impossible when I was younger. I know I can break my limits. I know I can become stronger. I will become stronger!
