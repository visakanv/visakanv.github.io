_(Started last week, finishing this now.)_

The title is a title of a book by Marcel Proust. I believe I first heard of it while reading something by Nassim Taleb – probably The Black Swan. Apparently it was a very influential novel, published in France in the 1910s and 1920s. I haven&#8217;t read the book, but I have read what others have written about it. It seems to be a book about a narrator reflecting on the passage of time, on the nature of memory. Virginia Woolf was a fan. I find myself thinking of Christopher Nolan, who I think is a modern-day version of someone who contemplates such issues and perspectives.

I&#8217;m talking about this I think because I feel like I&#8217;m getting older and like I don&#8217;t have a lot to show for it. Isn&#8217;t this the age where you&#8217;re supposed to be partying, supposed to be adventuring and so on? I experience a sort of wistful longing for the life that I&#8217;ve not led. I try to talk to other people who&#8217;ve led alternate lives, and I do find that basically everybody feels the same way. Everybody wonders if they&#8217;re on the right path. Everybody worries about the mistakes they might be making. Well not everybody, but everybody that I care about and relate to, for sure.

A colleague has mentioned to me a couple of times over the years that 27 tends to be the year that you really wisen up and go &#8220;oh shit, I&#8217;m a full adult, I&#8217;m responsible for myself and my life, I can&#8217;t be a drifter any more&#8221;. I&#8217;m 3 months away from being 27. I recall writing similar-ish blogposts about myself at ages 16, 18, 20, 21, 25 – every year is a year where you&#8217;re supposed to grow up a little, be more mature, be kinder, more gracious, more responsible, more competent, more of a genuine gift to the world. I refuse to be a person who turns 30 and is still listless, lost and confused about life. Of course, you don&#8217;t want to have a fake sort of confidence – that&#8217;s exactly what leads to a terrible midlife crisis. If I contemplate my life strategy so far, it might be fair to say that I&#8217;ve basically been elaborately trying to avoid running into a mid-life crisis. Which I think happens when you&#8217;ve been buying into a certain narrative that you&#8217;re sold – you assume certain things about how life is going to be, what is going to make you happy or fulfilled – and then after 20 years or so of that, you&#8217;ve been so invested in something, and you start to worry that it wasn&#8217;t quite right for you&#8230; and so you start to freak out and try to make some sort of drastic change at that point. Get divorced, quit your job, buy a sports car&#8230;

Yeah. So I&#8217;ve always been very skeptical of the straight path that most people seem to accept quite naturally. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m some sort of &#8216;natural misfit&#8217; that could just never do it, or if it was the way I was raised, or if it was the books that I read&#8230; probably some weird loop of all of the above, feeding on itself. I still remember being incredibly uncomfortable in Junior College. I&#8217;m probably misremembering it somehow that I&#8217;m older, but it seems to me now that it seemed to me then to be quite the farce. I think I had a snowball&#8217;s hope of getting into law (3-5%), and hoped to get into media (mass comm) or political science (NUS or SMU). It didn&#8217;t really occur to me that you could do really well, get a scholarship and study abroad. On retrospect, if I could live my life over, maybe that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d have aspired towards. I didn&#8217;t personally have any close family or friends who advocated for that, most seem to set their sights on local Uni. But again I might be misremembering all of this.

Where was I going with this?

At the highest level I just wanted to reflect on the passage of time, and how things change, and how things are so fragmented and multi-layered and multi-faceted, and how we remember remembering things, and we misremember things as we go. Sometimes I get the thought that I&#8217;m not going to live very long; like I&#8217;m going to get cancer or some other weird disease and die at 40 or something. I&#8217;d like to make it to at least 110 so I can live to see the year 110. But every day is a privilege, every moment is a miracle and I don&#8217;t want to take any of it for granted.

I find myself reflecting on my youth more and more these days. What was I trying to do as a kid, as a pre-teen, as a teenager, as a young adult? Where am I going with everything? What is my mind trying to wrap around, if it is at all? How are things going to change, how am I going to see things differently? What is going to surprise me? I think the big looming spectre is &#8220;parenthood&#8221; – do I want to be a dad? I actually feel like I&#8217;d be quite okay with it either way. If I don&#8217;t end up spawning my own little humans, I think I&#8217;d still find ways to get involved and help out with younger people&#8217;s lives – maybe foster kids at some point. At the same time, I have been feeling antsy about the fact that I haven&#8217;t done much travelling in my life. I&#8217;ve been mostly busy trying to stay employed. I don&#8217;t think I regret that. But I think I want more out of my life moving forward, and so I have to be a lot more deliberate about how I do whatever I do.

I wonder how I&#8217;ll feel reading this stuff a decade or two from now. I wonder if this project will be something I just lock away in the digital attic, or if it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ll revisit. I think I&#8217;ll enjoy hitting &#8216;random post&#8217; from time to time.
