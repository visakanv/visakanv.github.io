In the past year I&#8217;ve done over 100 word vomits of at least 1000 words each, which adds up to over 120,000 words. It has been an interesting experience, and I think I&#8217;m growing and changing as a writer-and-thinker.

When I started, all I knew is that I would be a different person at the end of it, and that I would have learned a bunch of things along the way that I couldn&#8217;t possibly anticipate.

While I still want to reach the 1000 x 1000 milestone, there are a few other things I now want to do as well. A few pertinent &#8220;side-quests&#8221; have popped up, and I feel like I can&#8217;t fully commit to the &#8220;main story mission&#8221; (1,000,000 words) unless I get these out of the way. I feel like the experience and powerups I&#8217;ll get from these side-quests will only add to my main mission, not subtract.

For a couple of years, my blog was centered around my Singapore-centric social commentary. A good 80% of my top-grossing hits are about Singaporean politics and media.

Since then, I&#8217;ve gotten married. I become a [homeowner](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/2013/01/0035-hdb/ "0035 – HDB"). I got a [full-time job.](http://visakanv.quora.com/Achievement-Unlocked-Gainful-Employment) I had a blogpost reach the [front page of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6468521). I became a [Quora Top Writer](http://www.quora.com/visakan-veerasamy/) for the 2nd year running.

My perspective has changed. My priorities have changed. My interests have changed. My blog has largely remained the same. [See: Derek Sivers&#8217; [Why am I here?](http://sivers.org/here)]

I still care about civil society in Singapore, and I will probably continue to speak up when I feel compelled to do so, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be devoting as much time and energy towards staying on top of everything. There are others who are more qualified than me who are making a meaningful difference.

What will I devote myself to, then? Here are some thoughts on my mind:

**1: I want to write about my vision for the future of education.** I find a lot of the discussions in this area to be painfully myopic. Almost everything I&#8217;ve seen involves some rearrangement of familiar elements such as &#8220;student&#8221;, &#8220;classroom&#8221;, &#8220;teacher&#8221;, &#8220;curriculum&#8221;, &#8220;degree&#8221;&#8230; all of which I think are assumptions that need to be questioned. We need to reason from first principles rather than think by analogy- I anticipate that education will be disrupted rather than reformed.

I will need to be careful when writing about this, though, and my word vomits are anything but careful. Vaguely, I think that I am the recipient of such a modern education. I don&#8217;t have a degree, ut I got headhunted to work with some really cool people nevertheless. I have skills and perspectives that not everybody else has, and they&#8217;re valuable enough for me to pay the bills with. Of course, I might be an exception or an outlier of sorts, but I don&#8217;t believe that is the case. That would be awfully presumptuous of me. At the very least, the path I have taken is open to thousands of others.

**2: Related to that, I want to write about what I perceive as &#8220;modern illiteracy&#8221;**. Reading, &#8216;riting and &#8216;rithmetic are necessary (and horrendously lacking in some parts of the world) but insufficient. What differentiates the &#8220;modern literate&#8221; is the ability to think, process, expound. That&#8217;s just the half that I&#8217;m familiar with. Lately I&#8217;ve found myself feeling very illiterate. I know far too little about large numbers, about businesses and corporations, about law, about nation-states, about computers and how the internet works, about financial systems. What is money? What is debt? What is insurance, and how do you make good decisions? I am incredibly unqualified to write about any of this- all I have is my curiosity, which I will have to use as a compass of sorts.

**3: I want to write about marketing in a way that is meaningful to me.** I already write about marketing for work, but I do that in a way that is more&#8230; &#8220;professional&#8221;? Since I&#8217;m working in this industry, I want to see how far the rabbit hole goes. I want to really sink my teeth into it, unearth the viscera.

I have a nagging suspicion that a large proportion of internet marketers or even marketers in general don&#8217;t really know what they&#8217;re talking about. I can&#8217;t just say that, of course- that&#8217;s irresponsible, accusatory, naive, ignorant. Again, just following my nose here. Why is marketing as convoluted and chaotic as it seems to be? Why are so many people simply mouthing platitudes and feel-good quotes? Where is the real work happening, where is it making a real difference, and why isn&#8217;t this data easily and readily available? I want to write about that.

**4: I know that I don&#8217;t want to keep writing about the same things.** I know that I want to review movies and books, but I&#8217;m not really sure why. I just have faith that I&#8217;ll be able to connect the dots when I&#8217;ve made significant progress.

**5: I know that I want to do real-life experiments and document them on my blog**. It&#8217;s funny, but one of the biggest epiphanies I&#8217;ve had from writing like crazy is that writing can only do so much. My writing guided me to realize that writing is inherently limited as a tool of exploration. It&#8217;s a fantastic tool, but ultimately it can only show you where you need to go, what you need to do. I attempted to do this in a very simplistic, superficial sense when I first started blogging here. You can dig into the archives and look for them if you like. They&#8217;re pretty embarrassing, vapid wannabe-motivational/lifehacker nonsense. But I&#8217;m keeping these posts around to remind me that you have to get the crap out of the way so you can get to the good stuff.

**6: I know that I want to be useful.** I&#8217;ve always wanted to be useful. My best writing and my best living, even, happens when I&#8217;m trying to be useful. Things start falling apart when I lose sense of that and start trying to impress people, or boost my ego one way or another.

I&#8217;m still figuring it out along the way. I know that I have a whole bunch of other things I want to write about. I want to write a history of Singapore that I personally find interesting. I want to write&#8230; there&#8217;s a lot of stuff I want to write.

The main quest still stands. I wonder what I will have changed my mind about at word vomit 200, 500, 1000. We&#8217;ll see.

Oh yeah, what have I learnt?

1: The early stuff is always crap.

2: Sometimes I&#8217;ll think something will take off, but it won&#8217;t.

3: Sometimes I don&#8217;t think something will take off, but it will.

4: Usually, if I find myself sweating (the sort of high-tension sweat I get in a high-stakes social situation, or even in poker), and I&#8217;m sort of frightened to publish, it&#8217;s a good sign. But sometimes it&#8217;s a total miss.

5: As I write more, I find myself able to sort my thoughts better as-I-go. I&#8217;m publishing this post without editing. I find that my unedited thoughts today are better than my edited thoughts a couple of years ago.

6: I warned my readers/audience that I was going to severely bore them with incoherent rambling. I expected the readership to drop. While the raw numbers did go down, I was getting great engagement. People were increasingly messaging and emailing me to tell me that they enjoyed reading my incoherent rambling. They found it more honest and compelling. I realize that my earlier numbers were entirely vanity metrics- I was getting clicks from people who just wanted to read controversial, anti-government rhetoric without engaging me. One of my most popular posts is &#8220;Sex in the ACJC&#8221;. I doubt those readers were very interested in what I had to say. Any regular reader of my word vomits, though, is a valuable asset to me (and probably a little crazy).

There ain&#8217;t no getting offa this train. I hope to do at least 200-300 vomits in 2014 as I make it a more integrated part of my routine.
