I logged into Facebook on a whim- I try to keep off it these days. I saw that Nassim Taleb was in Singapore. What are the odds of that? He elbowed me in the stomach accidentally when we were taking a group photo. I&#8217;ve met Lee Hsien Loong. Been tweeted by Margaret Atwood, Jimmy Wales. I&#8217;ve met and taken pictures witb Stu Hamm and Billy Sheehan. I make it a point to always try to ask a good question.

Yesterday I revisited the idea that life shoupd be interesting. I spent that night playing guitar. I&#8217;d like to be able to play with sounds better. Above all I think I&#8217;d like to play with words. This is why I&#8217;m doing the 1000&#215;1000 words project. Completing it will be interesting. I had a nice burst in the 60s or 70s but I&#8217;ve slowed down since. I&#8217;m not really happy about that. Life is excruciatingly short. I shouldn&#8217;t be missing my daily grind towards my goal. The grind IS the goal. The whole point is that a regular commitment to reading and/or writing will alter your mind, probably permanently. That&#8217;s the person I want to become. I want to be better than I&#8217;ve ever been.

I look back at my writing from earlier this year and I see a noticable difference. I&#8217;ve changed already. Is volume the differentiator, or is it something else? Probably both volume and experience.

But this doesn&#8217;t feel like a very interesting question to explore. You do the work, you reap the dividends, you refine your process along the way.

What is interesting? I&#8217;ll have to split this into work and pleasure. Well- do I? There are some things I can&#8217;t shake. Problems of procrastination, discourse&#8230; These are things I&#8217;d like to help work on. I&#8217;m not bring very clear. There&#8217;s a very noisy lady on the train (on the phone) and I&#8217;m struggling to tune her out.

I&#8217;ve come to feel more strongly about phrasing. I feel a need to hack away at bad phrasing.

Consider that last sentence. &#8220;I feel a need to heck away at bad phrasing.&#8221; The sentence that came out of me was actually &#8220;I feel a need to hack away at what I believe to be bad phrasing.&#8221; That&#8217;s a sentence that&#8217;s easily understood when spoken, because a speaker can use gestures and emphasis to guide his audience. &#8220;I feel a need to hack away at what I believe is bad phrasing.&#8221; (&#8220;is&#8221; is better usage then &#8220;to be&#8221;. It&#8217;s simpler and effectively means the same thing. There&#8217;s less chance of confusing your audience.)

[I meant to say &#8220;confusing or losing your audience&#8221;. It&#8217;s a minor but valid distinction. You can confuse an audience without losing them. I feel a need to cover all the bases. But this additional clarity comes at the expense of overall readability. I systematically sacrifice the general for the particular. Sometimes this is exactly what you want to achieve: sometimes precision is the most necessary thing in communicating something. But this isn&#8217;t the case with my writing. My overelaboration is a habitual tic, not a stylistic choice. I don&#8217;t recite poetry to swordsmen because I have some elaborate objective- I do it because I lack swordsmanship.

So this is what&#8217;s on my mind that I&#8217;d like to make deliberate. I&#8217;d like to write with fewer weasel words. In the long term, I hope I think with fewer weasel words too.

===

Life is short. At 23 I already have regrets. Not practicing harder. Not working harder. Wasting too much time on selfish things like winning arguments. I&#8217;ve developed some useful skills from arguing, but not so much from general idleness. I don&#8217;t think so. I wish I had been in more relationships. I wish I had invested more permanent skills.

I hopefully have at least another 10 years to live. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;d like to look at it. Longer pictures and I start romanticizing at the expense of actions.

Okay so I have ten years to live. I have to go to New York. (I should explore this train of thought, which had ended abruptly here, alas.)

===

This is going to be a task management type vomit so it might be pretty boring.

Why did I just think that? It&#8217;s a premptive apology. To who? The reader? Nobody&#8217;s meant to read this, this is for me. Am I apologizing to myself? I&#8217;m trying to reduce my own expectations? No, I&#8217;m definitely writing for others- but this is a self-selected audience of less than a hundred people, so why am I apologizing? If you don&#8217;t like it here, stranger, you&#8217;re welcome to leave. In fact I encourage it. If you&#8217;re here, you&#8217;re already wasting your time on something incomplete, unvarnished&#8230; potentially just noise.

It&#8217;s the equivalent of a standup comedian or a band in a nearly empty club apologizing for his unprofessional performance. Why apologize? Why not give it your best shot?

Maybe the apology isn&#8217;t for the lack of quality. The lack of quality is apparent to everyone. The apology is for the lack of effort. And that&#8217;s apparent only to the performer. (It might be inferred by the audience, but only the performer can be certain.)

So I&#8217;m not sorry that this is a pain in the ass to read. It is what it is. Take ir or leave it.

Okay, about task management, which I suck at. I&#8217;m writing about it because writing is a thinking tool for me.

One of the cool things about the work I do is that I don&#8217;t have an overly rigid set of tasks. You could say that one of my most pressing tasks is to think of better tasks to do. That said, it&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap of thinking instead of doing. Thinking as an excuse to avoid doing the dirty schlep work than inevitably needs to be done.

So I think it makes sense to schedule certain amounts of schlep work at regular intervals- things like responding to emails, for instance. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to think about whether or not I should be replying to emails right now. I should have a fixed period of time during which I answer emails and then leave it at that. Not having such structure is tiresome. It wastes precious cognitive resources day in and day out. I&#8217;ve noticed that having a fitness routine has made me fitter, happier and more productive, and I have since accepted that my life is better with fitness routines. Now I want to expand and extend that into other routines.

This is already working out for me. I have developed a routine of doing word vomits during my morning and evening commutes. The result is that I end up writing about 2000 words a day without having to dedicate cognitive resources to figuring out whether I should or not. My beeminder is noe a prompter that tells me I should practice guitar, read books, meditate. Maybe I should schedule all of those things, too. The point is that removing the &#8220;should I or should I not&#8221; and replacing it with a &#8220;yes, unless&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;no, unless&#8230;&#8221; is a much superior way of doing things.

Why didn&#8217;t I learn this when I was a kid? It seemed silly and trivial, and also it was stuff that I wasn&#8217;t actually very interested in. But I was throwing the baby out with the bathwater- by refusing to learn how to serve the agendas of others, I failed to learn to serve my own.

I didn&#8217;t respect anybody, and I refused to follow orders from anybody I didn&#8217;t respect. Well turns out I don&#8217;t really respect my conscious decision-making self either- so I don&#8217;t follow my own orders. I think the hack lies in questioning the obedience given to the subconscious- why is HE deserving of such unquestioning obedience? If you&#8217;re going to disobey undeserved authority, nobody should be immune.

So anyway&#8230; I need to chunk tasks together. It&#8217;s a little depressing that the most productive parts of my day seem to be my daily word vomits. I need to do something vomit-esque with my work. But what? I need to contain things into explosive bursts. Maybe I should start a pomodoro the moment I get into the office.

I tried eating some sushi after work before coming home. I feel a little clearer and less wasted.
