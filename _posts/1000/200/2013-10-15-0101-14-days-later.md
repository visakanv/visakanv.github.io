## Boring Preamble About My Word Vomits

This is my 101st word vomit of at least 1,000 words each. The early vomits were written under strict time limits- I used an app called Write Or Die (yeah, I actually paid for it!) which had a timer. Since starting work, I decided to write during my morning and evening commutes instead. In a bittersweet way, these vomits have become arguably my favourite thing. It&#8217;s when I feel most alive and productive. (I say bittersweet because I&#8217;d like to be as productive at work. I&#8217;m, uh, working on it. I&#8217;m going to make it happen.)

101 vomits. 101,000 words (actually more- probably closer to 115,000 or higher). And I&#8217;m just 10% of the way towars what I want to do. Why 1,000,000 words? Just an arbitrary milestone. I like the idea of it. My first vomit was on 2012-Dec-07, 3 days before I got married. I didn&#8217;t know this until a few seconds ago- but it was about video games and gamification. Here: [0001 &#8211; Video Games And Productivity.](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/2012/12/0001-video-games-productivity/)

Dinesh of ReferralCandy (now my boss, heh) would only email me on January 21st. The day after that, I would write [0035 &#8211; HDB](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/2013/01/0035-hdb/), which would go on to be the source for an article I wrote for PoachedMag: [Buying A HDB Flat.](http://poachedmag.com/2013/06/05/buying-a-hdb-flat/) (35 seems like a lot, but I was an unemployed bum at the time. 35,000 words.)

I got my smartphone at post [0039 &#8211; smartphone](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/2013/03/0039-smartphone/). This was a game changer. Post [0049 &#8211; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do well because I didn&#8217;t study&#8221;](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/2013/05/0049-i-didnt-do-well-because-i-didnt-study/) went relatively viral. It was being shared on Facebook, and actually ended up being read in Russia and Eastern Europe. I suppose there are many others like me who made up that bullshit excuse for themselves. It has 1,423 hits. I&#8217;ve had blogposts get more hits than that, of course- my [CISCO Wayang](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/2012/11/cisco-wayang/) post got over 20,000 hits and my [What&#8217;s PM Lee like in person?](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/2012/09/meeting-pm-lee/) post got over 19,000. (The latter post continues to climb, and will probably overtake the former in a few months.)

All of my top-grossing posts were about Singaporean politics. I got a bit of a thrill from the hits initially, but I got immune to it after a while. It&#8217;s just Singaporean politics. It&#8217;s easy to work people up into a frenzy and get lots of hits. But it&#8217;s not very fulfilling. My best non-SG blogpost was &#8220;[7 Lessons Smokers Can Teach Us About Getting Shit Done](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/2011/06/7-lessons-smokers-can-teach-us-about-getting-shit-done/)&#8220;. Then maybe stuff like my Hacking The 7 Sins series (I&#8217;m goning to rework that).

Then came my mega-hit (which now ranks 3rd, behind CISCO and PM Lee)- the productivity app blogpost. [0086 &#8211; productivity apps should be lighting fires, not filling buckets.](0086 – productivity apps fill buckets when they should be lighting fires - See more at: http://www.visakanv.com/blog/2013/09/productivity-apps-fill-buckets-when-they-should-be-lighting-fires/#sthash.Vh1qnIGp.dpuf) This got me to the front page of Hacker News. Oddly, the SG politics stuff sort of prepared me for it psychologically/emotionally. What I wasn&#8217;t prepared for were the emails- so many people emailing me telling me that they suffer from the same problems, that they want to build my app, asking for my input on stuff they&#8217;re working on. I&#8217;ve emailed some of those people back, I haven&#8217;t emailed others. (Hey, you knew I was a procrastinator before you emailed me.)

## So, what the hell is up, anyway?

I wrote about an app, but I apologize if I got anybody&#8217;s hopes up- I was merely using the concept of an app as a thinking tool. I don&#8217;t actually think that an app is the magical solution to all my problems. In fact, my word vomit habit is a better thing than most other things. Still, I felt that I was doing things in a suboptimal way and I was edgy and impatient to leap to something better. I looked through most of the ideas people sent me. What I didn&#8217;t mention in the previous blogpost is- I&#8217;ve tried practically everything there is out there (that&#8217;s free). I&#8217;m a junkie. I know what it&#8217;s like. I&#8217;ve done my research. I even experimented with a paid solution (RescueTime) but it didn&#8217;t work out for me- I&#8217;d just ignore it. I enjoyed HabitRPG for a while but it got buggy and that bothered me. Something didn&#8217;t feel quite right- it didn&#8217;t capture the growth and personal development in a way that I wanted.

Somebody commented &#8220;Have you tried Beeminder?&#8221; and I knew that I signed up for an account before- way back, when I wanted to keep track of my A level studies. I didn&#8217;t even get started on it, because I found the data entry intimidating. Daniel Reeves- one of Beeminder&#8217;s cofounders- emailed me personally to ask me if I&#8217;d try Beeminder. I knew that I had signed up for it before, which meant that I must have seen something in it. I googled him and found that he wrote this essay- [How To Do What You Want: Akrasia and Self-Binding](http://messymatters.com/akrasia/). I absolutely loved it (and will be reading it again). This made me decide that I was going to give Beeminder a serious try- if it didn&#8217;t work out, I&#8217;d move on to one of the many other options.

## It&#8217;s working. It&#8217;s working!

I haven&#8217;t had to move on to any other options. Upon figuring out how the data entry works (it drove me away the first time- I wasn&#8217;t interested/invested enough then to bother to put in the effort), I realized that it&#8217;s exactly what I needed. I&#8217;ve turned some aspects of my life into a game that I enjoy playing.

This is me after about one week of minding. The main goal is exercise- as long as I exercise regularly, everything else tends to fall into place. I set a minimum target of 15 sets a week. I then introduced &#8220;write&#8221;, and I think I set it at 5 a week. Then I introduced meditate and read (2 or 3 times a week each&#8230; manageable, soft.) The goal is to stay above the yellow line. It&#8217;s as simple as that. Keep the dots above the yellow line and you&#8217;re doing good. You&#8217;re on track. You&#8217;re a responsible person (within this framework). You&#8217;re okay.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7599" src="http://www.visakanv.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/beeminder-oct.png" alt="beeminder-oct" width="981" height="566" />](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/beeminder-oct.png)

Here&#8217;s what it looks like after another week. I&#8217;ve steepened the exercise target (which is why the data points themselves look less steep). I added guitar, because music is a source of joy in my life. A quick glance at the trends and I know what I ought to be doing. I should read something soon, to put that graph upwards. I should practice some guitar after that.

[<img src="http://www.visakanv.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/beeminder-oct-15.png" alt="beeminder-oct-15" width="594" height="449" />](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/beeminder-oct-15.png)

This I find is far more compelling and engaging than &#8220;don&#8217;t break the chain&#8221;, which for me always felt a little oversimplistic and a little insulting. (I KNOW- If I say that, I shouldn&#8217;t be breaking chains. Also, this is essentially a more elaborate form of don&#8217;t-break-the-chain. But it looks a little cooler, and it feels a little cooler, too.) I believe I&#8217;ll have to pay to track more stuff- but I&#8217;ll happily do that. First, I want nicer, smoother graphs for everything, and I want to steepen all of them. I want to get good at this. I want to level up. I want my overall output to increase. I&#8217;ve felt myself thinking &#8220;I don&#8217;t really feel like doing my squats and pushups today, but 20 pushups and I get a point on the graph! C&#8217;mon!&#8221;

It works, okay? It works. It&#8217;s working.

So is my life reasonably optimal right now? No, not really, not yet. My exercise routine looks and feels great, and my word vomit habit is great, but I think I can afford to read more, and most importantly I think I can afford to be a lot more productive at work- I think I could increase my work output very, very significantly.

None of this addresses my points about prompts- those are semi-internalized, and I get reminded of them when I look at my Beeminder graphs (which are on a pinned tab on my Chrome, and on an app on my Android phone).

In the meantime, I was thinking that I&#8217;d like to get to know more people who&#8217;re interested in this sort of thing. I&#8217;m tentatively going to propose a twitter hashtag #lightingfires. I think peer pressure will work great for this.

I have a lot more to say about this. But I just thought some of you would appreciate the fact that the &#8220;argh i have a productivity/procrastination problem&#8221; guy is making progress on his procrastination problem. If I can, so can you.

Btw, I don&#8217;t think that Beeminder&#8217;s perfect I think they could get a much sexier interface, make it more compelling, bla bla&#8230; but I&#8217;m just a user with lofty, endless feature requests. I&#8217;m sure they have a whole bunch of stuff to worry about. For the time being, this is the best tool I&#8217;ve tried, and I&#8217;ve tried many, many, many tools.

YMMV. But get in the damn car and floor it. I&#8217;m here if you need to talk. I think a very significant part of why I was determined to make this work for me was that I wanted to have something to show for it, so that I could maybe do something for others who&#8217;re in similar straits. I&#8217;m here for you. Let&#8217;s set your ass on fire.
