I decided that I was going to summarize and &#8220;process&#8221; my first hundred vomits before moving forward. I found myself repeating a few thoughts and ideas, and I figured that I ought to consolidate things. There&#8217;s also a sort of accumulated fatigue thing going on- a part of me is tired and wants some sort of change.

I naively hoped to summarize 100 vomits in a single post. Turns out 10 vomits pee posr is more like it. This is me systematically overestimating myself. In this case I understimate what I&#8217;ve done so far, and overestimate what I&#8217;m going to be able to do in the immediate future. I suppose this is consistent with the &#8220;overestimate changes in next 2 years, underestimate changes in 10&#8221; idea. We&#8217;re just bad at approximations like these&#8230; unless we practice.

I keep thinking that there&#8217;s some sort of holy grail- if I just rearrange things in some special configuration, I&#8217;ll snap out of the slump I don&#8217;t even realize that I&#8217;m in- and I&#8217;ll start churning stuff out like a beast. This might be doable but it cannot be at the expense of a minimum work threshold. In fact, it&#8217;s starting to be clear that the minimum work threshold is where the real magic happens. So I just need to do more of that. The exercise is feeling good and I can see changes in my body- I just need to adapt that to my work.

I do not want to be talking about this at word vomit 200. Things have to change so that they can get more interesting. I want things to be more interesting. I have to take steps to make things more interesting. I have to ration my time better. The beeminder stuff is working well for me.

I think it&#8217;s time for me to go on a &#8220;second level social media detox&#8221;. Tumblr seems to be my biggest weakness at the moment. The pictured are too pretty. Sometimes I read stuff that&#8217;s touching, compelling. But I have work I want to do and I have books I want to read. I can&#8217;t do these things until I finish those things. Have I even finished OB Markers yet? I don&#8217;t think so. I should get on that. I have too many unfinished pieces lying around and I should quickly and systematically finish them, merge them or discard them. Why have I been taking so long? Addiction to distraction.

Getting off cigarettes and Facebook have been great, and revealing. But I&#8217;m going to need new things to talk about soon, or I&#8217;ll be repeating myself, and repeating myself is boring. When you catch yourself repeating yourself over and over again, I think it&#8217;s a sign that it&#8217;s time to challenge yourself with something. Step outside the comfort zone and do something different, look at something in a new way. That&#8217;s where the magic happens and that&#8217;s where life gets interesting.

For me the challenge I think is to get my work done at a rate that is systematically ahead of deadline so that I can explore new and interesting things. This means writing. This means publishing. This means growth. I&#8217;ve been catching myself falling into old &#8220;discomfort minimizing&#8221; habits rather than &#8220;work maximizing&#8221; ones. I wonder if it&#8217;ll help to introduce cycles. I should probably steepen my requirements on beeminder so that it becomes more of a challenge.

I feel like I got a lot out of the summary of my vomits. Revisiting words that are from over 90,000 words ago allows me to approach them in a more neutral, impartial manner. The raw magnitude makes me more detached- in a good way. I don&#8217;t get too overwhelmed or desensitized- rather, I find myself able to be more attuned to what actually works. I liken it to reviewing your practice takes. That&#8217;s an element of deliberate practice, which is an order of magnitide more powerful than meandering practice. In chess players, intense study was a greater determinant of technical ability than anything else- even actual tournament gameplay time. Of course, these are people who play a lot to begin with. Way more than anybody else, way more than casual players.

This reminds me of a thought I had earlier, about refining the heuristics surrounding the 10,000 hour rule. There&#8217;s not much point analysing art if you don&#8217;t know how to wield a paintbrush (assuming you want to be a painter). That technical proficiency is a necessary prerequisite to mastery.

I know that I want more out of life and I know that I can do it. I have it in me. More accurately, there&#8217;s no me. Things are possible within a spectrum of possibility and I can visualize superior maxima points in terms of resource allocation. Should I sit down and write that out? Maybe I&#8217;ll do that but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll do it within the context of this vomit. I think I&#8217;ll do it with pen and paper. Going to go home, do my pushups and squats, eat my dinner, get a quick bit of work done and then I&#8230; will meditate and figure it out from there. Maybe I&#8217;ll read. Or plan my work and get started somehow. Or just relax with the wife.

Been feeling an urge to compartmentalize and refactor my life again- to take stock of everything and lay it out neatly. First principles.

It starts with the bag of chemicals that I call me. Mind (in the most mechanical, hardware sense) and body. Physical processes. Optimizing this starts with sleeping well, staying hydrated, exercising, eating healthy. I messed this up throughout my teenage years- I was constantly sleep deprived, staying up online for no good reason. I didn&#8217;t exercise.(On hindsight, one of the best pick-me-ups when feeling down is a brisk walk outdoors. Humans just aren&#8217;t meant to be cooped up. )

The best things I&#8217;ve been doing here have been to quit smoking, sleep better and eat more healthily. I&#8217;ve also incorporated a daily exercise routine into my life which makes me feel fresher, stronger, more confident. I think I&#8217;m reaching a stage where I should start pushing myself harder on the exercise front.

Quitting cigarettes has been great. I still end up bumming cigarettes from close smoker friends if and when I see them (roughly about once every two weeks or so), so I&#8217;m technically still a smoker, I guess, but I spend weeks being &#8220;clean&#8221;- and it&#8217;s a different existence altogether- cleaner, brighter, fresher. I smell better. Everything tastes better. The coughs and sniffles are gone. My nose and mouth feel &#8220;organic&#8221;, like fresh juicy vegetables rather than the dead, acrid ashtray they had become. I might still smoke a cigarette every so often but I feel very &#8220;done&#8221; with being a smoker- with having the constant companionship of cigarettes in my pocket. It&#8217;s a crutch, like a smartphone. It&#8217;s something to occupy yourself with, something that gets you off. Surely everybody understands what that&#8217;s like. Anybody who uses social media on the phone and has a coffee habit already kinda knows what it&#8217;s like to be a smoker.

Anyway. What comes after taking care of the meatbag? There are a bunch of things. Curiosity. My marriage. My job. My blog. Guitar. Reading.

I think of these things the two critical things are my marriage and my job- and this is maybe where I can do some refactoring because there are less important things that clamor for my attention. Tumblr, for instance, which I will put in the &#8220;creation-of-identity-through-cheap-performance&#8221; category. Facebook, Tumblr, Quora&#8230; all &#8220;general&#8221; social media use falls into this category. Getting into arguments on Reddit or Hacker News falls into this category. We do it to feel good about ourselves. I call it cheap because it&#8217;s easy to do- easily replicable. It&#8217;s like responding to email. It&#8217;s the very opposite of deep focused work. It&#8217;s like paddling and fooling around at the surface of the pool of idea/knowledge/brainspace instead of diving to the depths, where the treasures are.

I think getting off Facebook was good for me when I did it last and it might be time for me to take another sabbatical-from-everything, more intensely. What does my tumblr really mean to me, really? I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s interesting but it really ought to be a treat, like alcohol or candy. I don&#8217;t know.

Meditation is important and I need to do it more. The last time I did it, it compelled me to pick up a specific book. What will it compel me to do this time? It allows the dust to settle. Maybe I should keep a log of post meditation insights. Or maybe I should meditate before leaving work, and before leaving home, so that my vomits are less noisy. Let&#8217;s try that now, Brb.
