Today was an interesting day in terms of productivity. I woke up later than I&#8217;d have liked, and spent a bit of time just lounging around. And then I got around to doing some drilling work in the house – I moved a couple of whiteboards (a large one from the gym to the study, and a small one from my bedroom to the gym). I also doubly-secured the whiteboard in my living room (which was &#8216;flappy&#8217; because it was hanging off of two screws – I drilled in a couple more screws at the bottom to secure it). And I drilled in a new hand towel holder in the kitchen. All of that was really satisfying, though it took longer than I&#8217;d have liked. The drill bits are getting a little worn, and I should replace them. I particularly enjoyed having my Jaybird X3&#8217;s with me, because it was possible to listen to music in-ear while drilling. Listening to music over the speakers doesn&#8217;t help because the drill overpowers it, and wearing regular earphones is a little dicey because you don&#8217;t want any wires dangling off of you while you&#8217;re doing drilling work.

Afterwards, my wife and I spent some time in our study. We had just cleaned it out, so we put all of our books on the floor. It was quite an interesting experience, and one I wish we had experimented with earlier. It&#8217;s something that Marie Kondo recommends – put all your stuff out on the floor, and then touch it with your hands and see if it sparks joy. I didn&#8217;t exactly follow that formula – rather I used different colored post-its to sort them into different categories – books I love, books I WANT to read, books I&#8217;d LIKE to want to read, and &#8220;#shrug&#8221;. I&#8217;m eliminating a lot of the #shrug books, as well as many of the &#8220;I&#8217;d like to want to read this&#8221; books. I might give some of them away, and maybe keep the top 20-30% of the &#8220;want to want to read&#8221; books.

I found myself thinking that there&#8217;s definitely utility in going through things over and over again. I used to feel bad about this, and so there would be a considerable length of time between each review. If I wait too long, I&#8217;d have forgotten a lot of whatever it is that caught my attention and interest, and so each new session ends up feeling like I&#8221;m just re-doing what I had done the last time. And it feels very wasteful, like there&#8217;s no progress. I suppose a close analogy would be – it&#8217;s like going to the gym once every 3 months and feeling really unfit and weak each time, like you didn&#8217;t make any progress and like you shouldn&#8217;t have bothered at all. Your feelings and observations are correct, but the conclusion is misplaced. You SHOULD have bothered, you just should&#8217;ve bothered in much smaller amounts at a much higher frequency. This is what I want to get better at.

(I&#8217;m racing against the clock with this word vomit – I have 3% left on my Macbook battery.)

What is it that I want to remind myself of here? Heh – I want to remind myself to revisit everything – all the basics – at a much higher frequency. Ideally I should be doing it every single day. Every single morning and every single evening. There are only a few basic things in life that I need to care about. Breathing, posture, hydration, diet, sleep, exercise, social relations, work done, todo list, goals, chores, bills and so on&#8230; it can sometimes seem like too much to bear, but when I&#8217;m writing myself a word vomit every day, it becomes clearer that actually it only seems too much because I haven&#8217;t sufficiently broken things down into bite-sized components that I can deal with at my own time, at my own leisure.

Also I just simply have this silly habit of taking way too long to start doing anything. The way around this might be to just circle around the task itself – and have a sort of ritual or routine for the circling. I find myself thinking now about how I instinctively do a bunch of fast, deep breaths before doing heavy squats. There&#8217;s something about it that calms me down, that seems to give me the strength I need. I wonder if I could just do it without – like just breathe normally and start squatting. I think it could be done, but a part of me feels like my core might not be braced tightly enough (I&#8217;m pulling this stuff out of my ass) and I might get injured or something. I guess I could experiment with lower weights and see how it goes. I don&#8217;t know.

Anyway the point of that example is to help me think about how to act on other things. I think the system I use for working out should translate quite well to doing work tasks, for instance. I write down what I&#8217;m going to do, on the whiteboard. I block out a period of time – 30 minutes, an hour. I play music. And I don&#8217;t do anything else. And afterwards I reward myself in some way. That&#8217;s exactly what I should be doing with work. I should have a list and I should use that list to measure my progress, and I should use my progress to reward myself – both directly (as in, get pleasure from seeing a visible chart of progress) and indirectly (&#8220;I&#8217;ve done X, I&#8217;ve earned that Starbucks drink&#8221;).

So to recap, today&#8217;s reminders are – revisit your shit over and over again so that it remains fresh – that way you can pick up where you left off and actually start exploring new territory. Set aside a short amount of time to do it. You don&#8217;t need to spend hours and hours on a thing each time you do it. Just pay attention to how it feels right now, to have published one word vomit per day of 2017. You&#8217;re going to hit 10 soon. Each new milestone will feel great. No zero days. A little bit every day. Done is better than perfect. C&#8217;mon!
