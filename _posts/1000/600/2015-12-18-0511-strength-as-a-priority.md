The more time I spend online, the more I read news articles and forums and reddit, the more I look at what&#8217;s going on on Facebook and Twitter, and even with group chats with friends, the more I&#8217;m convinced that most things are just entertainment. [1] Time-pass. I wanted to say mindless entertainment, but that can be a little misleading because this entertainment can be really engaging. You can end up using up a very substantial amount of your limited cognitive resources just thinking about and discussing some issue that you&#8217;re not actually directly involved in, that you&#8217;re not going to make a direct impact in.

I used to be very involved in peripheral discussions, and I still sometimes get involved, so I&#8217;m very aware of the justifications involved. A seductive idea is that everything is connected and that we&#8217;re always involved whether we like it of not, and that it&#8217;s bad to be aloof, it&#8217;s bad to be distant and uninvolved when there&#8217;s so much pain and suffering and injustice in the world. No drop of water feels personally responsible for the flood. But we have a &#8220;moral responsibility&#8221; to get our hands dirty, to get involved.

This was an easy decision to make when I was in college or when I was a conscript- I didn&#8217;t care for what I was doing, I was checked out. So everything else was endlessly fascinating and deserved my full attention. As I&#8217;ve gotten older though, I&#8217;ve gotten more responsibilities, bills to pay, a job I actually like. And these are all things that demand my time and energy, which is limited. So I have to think more carefully about how I want to allocate resources.

I don&#8217;t actually need to compromise on my fundamental principles and values. Or rather, my principles were vague to a degree I did not realize until I was forced to make them precise. This project is part of my way of developing more clarity about my own priorities. If I had infinite time and energy I would sit down with every single human being and talk to them for decades. But I don&#8217;t have unlimited resources. So I&#8217;m forced to prioritize.

So then. Thought experiment. If I can only talk to one person, who should I talk to? That&#8217;s obvious, me. I am the most important, significant, influential person in my life. Visa is the biggest player in the game of Visa&#8217;s life, which is interconnected with other people&#8217;s.

(I paused writing here because I got to work.)

So. While the previous statement is &#8220;obvious&#8221;, are my actions consistent with my belief? It doesn&#8217;t feel like it. So thatâ€™s a no. I do believe that I am the most consequential person in my life, but I do not behave as if that were true. My actions are not consistent with what I think my priorities should be. If I were true, then I would be talking to myself first thing in the morning and last thing at night, every single day.

The fact that I publish these vomits in a public space implies that I care about what other people think. Which is fine. It&#8217;s possible to care about multiple things at once. The question is what do I care about MOST? It appears I&#8217;ve never really been able to properly give a good answer to that. Every single time I&#8217;ve talked about it in the past, or tried to approach it, even by myself in private, I find it difficult to come to a good honest answer that I can truly get behind.

I think I can now say that the answer is personal strength. I&#8217;ve experienced about 5 weeks worth of strength training (in the physical fitness sense) and I find myself feeling stronger in a very fundamental way that I had never considered before. When you lift a heavier weight than you were ever able to lift in your life, and you do it with just a little bit of concentrated effort, you begin to wonder what else you can destroy with a little bit of concentrated effort.

Now I&#8217;ve known this intellectually for a long time. I&#8217;ve been writing about it for a long time. But it somehow required me to lift a heavy ass weight over my head and feel it in my muscles and bones before I found myself beginning to &#8220;truly believe&#8221; that this is true for me.

Caution-check: Is this really true? Is this new? Is this different? Haven&#8217;t I said or done this before? Surely I&#8217;ve experienced getting stronger in some way before. I find myself thinking about learning a particular song on the guitar and how that makes me feel more powerful. Learning to play Radiohead&#8217;s Exit Music (For A Film) made me realize that I can develop my musicality to places that I had previously thought were unnavigable. But then I still haven&#8217;t gotten around to properly playing Nat King Cole&#8217;s L O V E. It&#8217;s achievable, I know it&#8217;s within my reach, but I haven&#8217;t sat down to practice it. So I should make it a priority. I should print it out and play it in my spare time. Because once I&#8217;m able to play it, I know that I&#8217;m able to play a whole bunch of other things, too. And I deeply enjoy it. I deeply enjoy being able to do things that I wasn&#8217;t able to do before. And I think that is my highest priority in life. To grow stronger, more powerful. Because that is pleasurable in itself, and that gives me more resources and leverage to do everything I want to do.

[1] Etymology time! The word entertain is made up of &#8216;enter-&#8216;, as in entrepreneur, enterprise, which seems to mean &#8216;to undertake&#8217;, &#8216;within&#8217;, and &#8216;-tain&#8217;, which means &#8216;to hold&#8217;, as you see with contain, maintain, sustain. It gets interesting to think about why we like to be entertained. We want to be held, to be transfixed, to be captivated. There&#8217;s a sense of fixedness. Is it a big leap to suggest that we&#8217;re somehow afraid of change? Of flux, of darkness, wetness? That if we weren&#8217;t held in place by something, we&#8217;d fall into the unknown, or fall apart, and that&#8217;s scary or uncomfortable in some way.
