So the first month of 2016 is over. I&#8217;ve done a few good things. I&#8217;ve met some friends- I remember 4 specific meetups in particular. I&#8217;ve worked out, broke a PR or two, even went for a (crappy) run. I watched a couple of good movies and even an entire TV show with the wife. We had a couple of dates, which were pleasant. Woke up early a few times. Didn&#8217;t read any new books, but did some re-reading. Kept track of maybe half of the things I wanted to keep track of- diet, books, Internet habits. I think I spent a little less time on Reddit and Imgur and FB. Had a productive and challenging meeting with the boss. Feeling challenged in a good way about the month(s) ahead.

What didn&#8217;t go so well- I didn&#8217;t read or write as much as I would&#8217;ve liked. I feel like I could&#8217;ve been more productive at work, which will be my 3rd priority this month after health and writing. I&#8217;m going to try and publish a vomit every day for the month of Feb. I&#8217;m going to be out of the country for a week so that means I&#8217;ll have to do double the writing in another week.

I&#8217;d like to keep doing monthly reviews for the remainder of the year, and subsequently for the rest of my life. I&#8217;ve been circling around this for as long as I&#8217;ve been writing. I did it when I was blogging as a teenager, I did it in my notebooks when I was a conscript. I think the idea was- I&#8217;m pretty Smart, so if my life isn&#8217;t the way I want it to be, I should be able to Smart my way out of it. It&#8217;s been taking a lot longer than I hoped, but I&#8217;ve definitely made significant, substantial progress. Old friends have told me so, and it&#8217;s really nice to see your development through the eyes of others.

So what&#8217;s next? Same as it has been for a long time: thinking and working towards becoming a more effective, powerful individual who&#8217;s able to skillfully navigate reality. To make life an adventure rather than an ordeal. Doing regular reviews is going to be critical for that, especially for me because I&#8217;m so haphazard and sloppy.

I&#8217;d like to be able to say in 2017 that I&#8217;m the opposite of haphazard and sloppy. That I approach my life like a warrior, king, ninja, samurai, Man, Christian, whatever positive adjective- the label doesn&#8217;t really matter.

I&#8217;d like to read less crap and spend less time responding and reacting to crap. To tend to my &#8216;mind-garden&#8217;, to build relationships with people that make me happy. To eliminate obligation-debt. To be more disciplined, and yet to avoid the trap of fetishizing it. I think I spent a lot of time in that trap. Feeling anxious and guilty about not meeting unfairly high standards, and then collapsing and giving up altogether. The challenge is the same as always- baby steps, incremental progress. To have manageable gradients rather than an insurmountable, discouraging cliff. [1]

I ended this vomit here, but I think I can pick up where I left off. It&#8217;s now the end of the first week of February 2016. I think I&#8217;m doing okay. I just need to keep revitalizing myself. It&#8217;s okay to slip up as long as I get back on track. And I think every weekend is an opportunity to survey the past week and get back on track, and to make corrections and adjustments accordingly. I will definitely continue doing monthly reviews. On a personal level I think I&#8217;m going to do weekly reviews too, but I don&#8217;t want to get too brazen about it and jinx it. I&#8217;ll just quietly keep track of how I&#8217;m doing week on week and see how that works out.

I guess I&#8217;m really just feeling this thundering passage of time. Facebook reminded me that it&#8217;s been 3 years since I started work. And how much has changed since then? A lot, and not much. I&#8217;m definitely a little more self-aware then I was then. I&#8217;m less reactive, less brash, more composed, more able to control myself, to wait before I respond. I respond to fewer things.

I recognize that fewer things deserve my time and energy. Earlier on the Uber ride home I was scanning through Facebook for a few minutes and I noticed things that, 3 years ago, I would have tediously responded to. Take the latest current affairs in Singapore– that a 14 year old teenage boy committed suicide by jumping to his death after being accused of molesting a girl, and being questioned for 3 hours by the police. I don&#8217;t know the details. I don&#8217;t know what actually happened. I know that it&#8217;s complex and complicated. And I know that people are emotional, hurting, upset. I know that there are political points to be scored, essays to be written. But I&#8217;m not going to be getting involved in that. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t care anymore. I do. But I now recognize that it&#8217;s much better for me, and by extension, for the people I care about, and everything else that I want to achieve, if I start by focusing on the things that I can make a substantial, lasting difference to.

I wonder if my past self would look at me now and think of me as some sort of sellout. But I&#8217;m not eschewing my fundamental beliefs or anything like that. I&#8217;m not saying or doing things that I don&#8217;t believe in just so I can get money or fame or anything of the sort. I&#8217;m just prioritizing. (Is this rationalizing? That&#8217;s for future me to reflect on.)

[1] I initially used the word &#8220;demoralizing&#8221; and decided &#8220;discouraging&#8221; was a better fit. It&#8217;s interesting to contemplate the subtle distinction between the two. Morale is about mood, morals are about ethics. Courage is about heart, conviction. We use the two somewhat interchangeably but there&#8217;s some nuance in the distinction. To discourage someone doesn&#8217;t seem as bad as to demoralize someone. Actually, on retrospect, demoralize might&#8217;ve been the better word.
