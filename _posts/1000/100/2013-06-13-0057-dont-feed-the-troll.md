Work today. Stuff I&#8217;m proud of:

1: I avoided feeding a troll today. I&#8217;m typically someone who&#8217;s fairly easy to troll. I&#8217;m someone who can be rather insecure and easily offended. I also can rarely resist the urge to get into an argument, because I like to think that I&#8217;m good at arguments, and it gives me a feeling of busyness. It&#8217;s like playing candy crush maybe. The act of argument triggers &#8220;low-lying fruit&#8221; in my pleasure circuitry (I&#8217;m so sorry that my understanding of neuroscience is so horrible but you know what I mean). It becomes something like smoking or masturbating: feels good, achieves little. I avoided that to some degree,  and that felt great. Remember Visa, Elon Musk does not have time to argue with people. He speaks only before broad self-selected audiences, and works on problems in the interim. (That&#8217;s part of the problem of Facebook, in my opinion- there&#8217;s a slightly negative social outcome when people get roped into discussions they didn&#8217;t opt-into. This can be positive or negative depending on the context and it&#8217;s remarkably hard to manage.  Anyway I want to be spending progressively less time on Facebook because I want to spend my time doing &#8216;deep work&#8217;- work that emerges from extensive consideration and rumination&#8230;

2: I started and completed a blogpost at work within a couple of hours. This is a big deal to me because for some reason my work-related blogposts are slow, laggy, lethargic. I think it has to do with perfectionism borne of being accountable to somebody, which kept me from doing my best&#8230; I wonder if there&#8217;s a part of me that rather be perceived as lazy than incompetent. Well- lazy IS incompetent. You&#8217;re incompetent either way, Visa, so wake the fuck up and get to work.

3: in proud of myself for developing this habit of writing on the trains. This is the 3rd or 4th large vomit that I&#8217;m doing on my commute and it feels fucking incredible. It makes me feel like I&#8217;m making real progress with myself. I still haven&#8217;t practiced meditation yet- not sure why I&#8217;m putting it off- but I&#8217;m writing. That&#8217;s the best part. Writing writing writing everyday.  No excuse not to. Word vomit on the train is an elegant proposition, like squats in the shower or a jug of water in the fridge. Speaking of which,  I need to have some healthy snacks at home. I need to incorporate a &#8216;cycling&#8217; practice at work- I&#8217;ve been meaning to test this idea, that physically changing my location at regular intervals will improve my productivity.

Most important insights&#8230; don&#8217;t try to do things all at once. Chunk chunk chunk. Baby steps. I haven&#8217;t done my poached article yet- what will I write about? I&#8217;m such a bloody perfectionist! Seriously need to kill the bugger. Hopefully writing about this day in and day out will make a difference. Sorry if you&#8217;re bored. (I&#8217;m not doing this to help or entertain you anyway. Why are you even reading this? )

An insight I had that I&#8217;m probably repeating- it&#8217;s important to schedule stuff in advance because it&#8217;s so hard to make good decisions at the end of a work day.

I made an odd call today that I&#8217;m not sure what to think of. I was at work and being productive, but it was getting late and I was going to be late for remedial training. But I was on a roll! I decided it was more important to me to keep the productivity going, and I completed the post I was working on. Success!  And yet a kind of pyrrhic victory. I want to reach a stage where I become a responsible, trustworthy person who&#8217;s always on time for appointments. Seriously my tardiness is just insulting and disrespectful to everyone and that&#8217;s not who I want to be. So I&#8217;m commiting to simple things like going to work on time, going to bed on time&#8230; 16 year old Visa  would kill me for saying this but I need more structure in my life. Structure will allow me to massively increase my output, which will literally transform the game I&#8217;m having.

Heh I just had a funny recursive thought about how I&#8217;m repeating myself and I&#8217;m sorry for repeating myself and how even that apology is repetitive&#8230; I make no apologies for that though. Children learn through repetition, all learning involves repetition and if repeating this plays a role in reshaping my brain then I will do it!

It occurred to me while I was at work that there&#8217;s more stuff that can be done than there is time to do it. I know, this technically applies to life itself, but it&#8217;s a strange and unfamiliar problem if you&#8217;re used to a life of trying to minimize discomfort.

What are the best things I can do? Colonize the acquisition channels. Do some reading. Motivate my peers. Act. 80/20 bro.

(Just caught myself resenting someone for playing candy crush on the train. Why so judgemental visa? Psuedo-psychanalysis: I resent people who remind me of my own negative properties. So if I make a big deal about candy crush it&#8217;s because&#8230; even though I don&#8217;t play it, I recognize it for what it is: a trivial and mundane addiction. This reminds me- I&#8217;ve actually had negative reactions to watching friends and loved ones using Facebook. What the fuck! You condescending prick, how hypocritical can you get? I know, I know. I&#8217;m sorry.

In random news I just paused to buy some fruitella sweets and I realized that if there&#8217;s something called an addict personality or archetype, I probably fit it to some degree and it has some parallels or symbiotic intertwining. What&#8217;s the relationship between addiction and general responsibility, if any? Are there people who&#8217;re highly responsible in one sphere, but say, substance addicts in another? I imagine it&#8217;s possible, and it&#8217;s highly complex, and I&#8217;m generalizing it in a way that doesn&#8217;t do justice to the general picture.

There&#8217;s something there, though. Binge eating, drinking, sleeping, smoking, etc. Anybody got any good links to read about these things? Will look them up on my own time otherwise
