So what lenses should I build, what have I built, what is actually useful? (Let&#8217;s drop the lens analogy.) The answer is seemingly straightforward- whetever helps me get from where I am go where I want to go. Well, where am I, and where do I want to go? The &#8220;expand human consciousness&#8221; and &#8220;accelerate space travel&#8221; destinations are too far down the road to be particularly meaningful. They&#8217;re vague abstractions at this stage. It&#8217;s like me saying I want to go to the USA when I don&#8217;t know where Changi Airport is. Saying you want to marry the princess when you don&#8217;t know where the kingdom is, let alone what the political challenges are gonna be when you get there, and what sort of prerequisites you&#8217;ll need to even get through the door.

So. What and where is Changi airport? And how do I buy or acquire a ticket? And what do I have to do to pay for or earn that ticket? If I met Seth Godin or Paul Graham or Jimmy Wales or Elon Musk any of those cool people, I wouldn&#8217;t have anything useful to tell them. That sucks. I don&#8217;t just want to be some passive fan in the crowd, I want to get onstage and play some awesome music. I just remembered watching the Tesla shareholder meeting where this guy essentially begged Musk for a job. Musk was pretty gracious about it (I think because of his own past experience doing cold approaches like at Netscape), but I couldn&#8217;t help but cringe for the guy. Begging is a very bad strategy. (The only worse strategy is to do nothing at all.) Seduction is a good metaphor here. You want to be headhunted. Tesla and SpaceX ARE hiring. The goal should be to be so good that they can&#8217;t ignore you. (Should I be reading more Cal Newport? )

Even if I suddenly made a lot of money, what good would that do me? I&#8217;d do things like get nicer clothes and shoes. Work out more. Really? Who am I kidding? I can do these things right now. I can get fitter. I can develop more refined social graces with deliberate practice. I don&#8217;t need money to do that. I might get less jittery when playing poker, but there are multiple ways to skin that cat. But what? What then? I have this library of books I&#8217;d like to read. That&#8217;s just something I feel like I need to do, I feel like I&#8217;d be a better, more thoughtful and wise person for it. I&#8217;d understand the world better.

Erm, but what is it exactly that I don&#8217;t understand right now? I think the most pressing thing is computers and programming. I&#8217;d like to understand that stuff better. I hate feeling like I don&#8217;t understand computers. I&#8217;d like to build one from scratch. I think that would make me very happy, that would be a useful skill, experience, journey. I&#8217;d like to learn to code so I&#8217;d have more computing power to explore currently-vague questions in my mind. Maybe I&#8217;ll find that I enjoy contributing to open source. I can envision Google maps being far more awesome than is today, but I am oblivious to how it works. What the hell is an API? Why do I not know this? This is the stuff that should replace tits and ass on tumblr. I don&#8217;t think I can juggle too much in my head. It has to be keyhole surgery, like Harford described. Where should I begin? Music? I&#8217;m hungry for growth and learning but my progress is slow because there isn&#8217;t a clear path. I don&#8217;t have a counter-insurgency manual.

I was thinking about information diets and diets in general- how it seems extreme to deliberately starve oneself of something for an indefinite period of time. Surely the occasional cigarette, whiskey, chocolate, porn video- can&#8217;t be all that bad as long as the rest of your life is in order? An obsession with freedom is in itself another pair of handcuffs, isn&#8217;t it? But that&#8217;s the simplicity on the other side of complexity. You can only discard that ladder after you&#8217;ve climbed it, otherwise you&#8217;ll (I mean I&#8217;ll) use it as an excuse to remain stagnant, static, setting-sun, defensive&#8230; I just realized that me stayinf in my comfort zone is no different from the record companies and big businesses I laugh at because they can&#8217;t pivot, can&#8217;t innovate, are structurally condemned to being eaten alive. I am that old company, stuck in that local optima, trying to hang on despite greatly diminishing returns. It&#8217;s like being stuck on a small hill when there&#8217;s a flood, and refusing to swim into the open sea to reach a higher peak&#8230; it seems irrational from the global view, but not from the local view. So I neex to constantly kick my own ass ans constantly see the global view. I hope this daily writing habit makes me do that. I have faith that it will. You can&#8217;t do something every single day and not be changed by it.

I need more momentum- and this isn&#8217;t external energy, it&#8217;s momentum from within me. I just need to use a little bit of energg to blockade the paths of least resistance. I cannot and should not go online when I get home. I&#8217;m going to get in, kiss my wife, do some pushups and squats, clean the cat litter, take a dump, shower, have dinner, get a quant of work done, maybe do some reading and go to bed- and tomorrow I&#8217;m going to snap out of bed insteas of snoozing two hours away. Life is too precious to snooze on a regular basis. Once in a while maybe, but it cannot and should not be a norm. It&#8217;s a really silly problem to have, a coping mechanism I&#8217;ve developed because I&#8217;m so afraid of facing the world with all my unfulfilled obligations. So this is the strategy then. Seems doable. Write everyday to focus my thoughts. I&#8217;m going to start meditating in the morning if possible.

Okay I&#8217;m home, it&#8217;s a wrap. Wow, that was two word vomits in one session.
