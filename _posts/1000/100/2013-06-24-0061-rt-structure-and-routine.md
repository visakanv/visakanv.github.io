Wow this morning&#8217;s post was over 1.5k words. Somewhat remarkable. I just left work because I got to head to remedial training at Khatib Camp. I have to do remedial training because I didn&#8217;t complete my IPPT within 9 months from my birthday, which was 2 months after my ORD. I am not resentful about this. You do the crime, you do the time. I knew the rules (though I wasn&#8217;t very mindful of them and pretty much forgot about them), so I have no excuse.

I&#8217;ve been to three RT sessions so far. I need to do 20 altogether. That&#8217;s a total of 40 hours of my time. I get paid about 10-12 dollars per session, I believe.

Could I make better use of 40 hours of time? Hypothetically, sure. Realistically, if I had done my IPPT and gotten it out of the way, I would waste my hours stoning on the internet. I only protest the waste of my time when it&#8217;s because of external circumstances. Time I waste myself is completely okay. (Until something bad happens, and I find myself horribly unprepared and ill-equipped- then I resent myself for not practicing, not working out, not doing the reading,  etc.)

I&#8217;m not talking about pleasurable downtime, by the way. That&#8217;s beautiful. The apple cider you have after a hard day of productive work is very different from binge drinking every day because you have nothing better to do with your life.

I find myself thinking about national service. I&#8217;ve been meaning to put together a little guide for NSFs trying to figure out how to make the most of their 2 years of NS, but I&#8217;ve been fraught by perfectionism. I should probably just ship out a minimum viable post and just add to it over time.

I think one of the best ways to deal with NS, and RT, is to be determined to make the most of it. I think the same applies to JC too, but I was too blindly idealistic then, and naive, and ignorant and egocentric. It was my way or the highway- and so it was the highway. You can&#8217;t try to out-stubborn life into having your own way. Life is ruthless and it will beat you down mercilessly.

I went into NS deciding to make the most of the experience. It turned out to be rather bland and unfulfilling for me, so I was determined to do the minimum possible (without getting into trouble, of course) and do as much as I could&#8217;ve outside of NS. On hindsight I could&#8217;ve done more, but hindsight is always 20/20. I spent some great quality time with friends, I did quite a bit of reading and writing- I read Lost Illusions, The Black Swan, Carl Sagan&#8217;s biography, Soul Made Flesh, Norwegian Wood, Plato&#8217;s Republic and a bunch of other great books. I wrote a whole lot on my blog. I built an online community, all sorts of good stuff. I was hoping to be an officer, actually- to become a more responsible and respectable person, but I was unable to because of medical reasons. Man, the medical nonsense I went through was pretty hilarious on hindsight. But that&#8217;s the price of running a citozrm army I guess. I&#8217;m not going to complain about that. It is what it is.

I should consolidate that elsewhere. So I&#8217;m determined to make the most of these 40 hours. I&#8217;ve cut out fitness from the rest of my life in the meantime (though I thoroughly plan to resume it once RT ends). I&#8217;m approaching it as a meditative process- 20 sessions of two hours of quiet, still mind. I&#8217;m determined to extract all the value I can from that.

That said, the bigger question and challenge is- how do I get the most out of life at a broader level, rather than within the context of RT? If I had simply done my IPPT and saved these 40 hours, what could I have done with the time that would&#8217;ve been superior?

A big part of life is learning to appreciate the scenery on a detour- but we can&#8217;t spend our time continuously making detour after detour. If we can minimize unnecessary detours, surely we should? I&#8217;m aware of the &#8220;life is what happens when you&#8217;re busy making other plans&#8221; school of thought and I understand the value and importance of serendipity- but great serendipity and great detours happen when the road you&#8217;re on is great to begin with. I don&#8217;t believe in spending all of one&#8217;s time planning- everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. But to just drift with the wind strikes me as suboptimal.

Alright, just done with RT. You know, I&#8217;ve had this thought a few times, and it was especially poignant when I was volunteering in prison- that prison, NS and now RT- it&#8217;s kinda good for sone people. For some people, it could be lifechanging,  even life _saving_. Think about the ultra fat kid who becomes fit during NS- we all know a guy like that. Not everybody makes that transformation, and not everybody sticks to it- in fact many fit people fall off the wagon in the middle of life somewhere.

This is a point I have to make very carefully. People can benefit from structure and routine. In the absence of good routines we fall into bad ones.  Let&#8217;s not overcomplicate this- I&#8217;ve noticed that my life seems to fall into place a lot better when I&#8217;ve been writing. If I haven&#8217;t been writing, I get edgy and cranky and I struggle to focus on any other task I might be obliged to do. This can be incredibly frustrating and painful, and the &#8220;lack of structure&#8221; screws up my pattern. On the other hand, if I&#8217;ve been writing, I kind of breeze through the day with more clarity and confidence.

So all else held constant, if I had some sort of structure/routine (and I&#8217;m building one) for keeping me on track with my writing, I&#8217;d be better off as a person. I&#8217;m pretty sure that this applies to multiple circumstances, not just writing.
