My feedly isn&#8217;t loading and social media has diminishing returns so I souls just start writing. My mind isn&#8217;t particularly clear. I notice that there&#8217;s something that happens to my mind when I&#8217;m on social media for too long: I start thinking in a very short-term short-wavelength manner and it becomes harder to do the kind of &#8216;deep thinking&#8217; you need to do to catch insights and say something meaningful&#8230; I&#8217;m taking out of my ass here trying to make sense of my subjective experience.

I notice that when I read books, I often have to stop halfway to stay writing because the thoughts get pushed to the front of my mind and I can&#8217;t enjoy the book without getting the thoughts out of my mind first. It&#8217;s a funny problem to have.  I suppose I could experiment with ignoring the thoughts so I can fully immerse myself in the joy of reading, as I did as a child. Reading for me these days is highly interactive: I take notes, I write down the thoughts that arise in my mind and make connections to other books and ideas. It&#8217;s almost like I can&#8217;t read without getting involved. I can enjoy comedy or a play or an art exhibition and take notes _afterwards_, but somehow I don&#8217;t have that patience with books. Books are for snorting hurriedly, at least that&#8217;s how it is at this stage in my life when there&#8217;s so much to ingest.

Funny how that analogy plays out. I&#8217;m wiring this on the way to work and I wonder if I can complete and publish it before I get started. That&#8217;s rather ambitious but maybe it&#8217;s worth a shot, maybe it&#8217;s a routine worth trying out.

Random but I believe strongly in the value of re-reading things, re-watching things. You&#8217;re never the same person twice, so approaching the same text twice is a remarkably good way to figure out where you&#8217;ve been and how you&#8217;ve changed and grown. I was rewatching Melinda Gates&#8217; Ted talk about Coca-Cola and how they&#8217;ve found remarkable solutions to problems that  governments and NGOs hadn&#8217;t. So full of awe at the entire process and how it saves lives, and how simple some solutions are.

I also watched a talk by a counsellor explaining how people in their 20s have been encouraged to be complacent when it&#8217;s the most defining decade of your life. I like that because I feel like it glorifies my personal narrative. I was complacent for the first 20 years of my life, so I&#8217;m determined to work hard now.

Which brings me to the idea of social comparison as a motivator. Should you use it? Is it ultimately unhealthy and self-destructive? I know a lot of wise guru type folks say that you should only be competing against yesterday-you, and let other people be other people. Yet we do use scoreboards and leaderboards in games and reality,  because clearly we&#8217;re motivated by social cues (being social animals).

I&#8217;ll admit it- a part of me wants to &#8216;get back&#8217; at people who&#8217;ve looked down on me in the past. I like the idea of overtaking the superachiever kids add they begin to struggle with questions of purpose and meaning. When you&#8217;re done with your expensive degree and have spent a few years working your high-paying job and realize you&#8217;re not that happy, Ha Ha Fuck You!

But then I pause to check myself. Is that really who I want to be? It&#8217;s a little petty and small-minded isn&#8217;t it? First of all it&#8217;s unfair of me to hate on people without knowing their full circumstances. Everybody has a hard battle to fight. Second, hate is like drinking poison and hoping they die. Sure it might be entertaining to some but what do I really want? In a way, peer approval can be like a drug that keeps you where you are, for better or worse.

(Solution: write about anger and envy and vengeance to communicate that it&#8217;s on your mind, then demonstrate through action that you reject the low road- win-win! There&#8217;s surely a flaw in that somewhere that hasn&#8217;t revealed itself to me.)

When a dust has been kicked up I think clarity is achieved by deciding what you want to focus on. Rather than going &#8220;Everything&#8217;s a mess, what should I do?&#8221; I should go, &#8220;Well, what do I want then?&#8221;

Then it gets easier. I want to play a role in diminishing human suffering and increasing human wellness- achieving this by creating and promoting anything that broadens human consciousness. The grand goal is to accelerate the advent of accessible commercial space travel. That&#8217;s the prize.

(I just got to work. That was 777 words written from Bishan MRT to one-north MRT. Not too bad I suppose.)

So actually, the whole &#8220;should I compare myself to other people as motivation&#8221; idea is a little pointless, and weak, because that comparison involves feeling good about &#8220;being better&#8221; than other people. I intellectually know that this leads to conditional self-esteem, which is unhealthy because either you&#8217;re not good enough, or you have to be stressed all the time trying to maintain your lead, and that&#8217;s frustrating and tiresome. Also, there&#8217;s an indirect implication that other people screwing up will make you feel better about yourself, which is not cool- that doesn&#8217;t serve the mission. The mission here is to commercial, accessible space travel, and we need everybody on board for such a vast mission. So I have to help people, even the rich kids. If I believe strongly enough in my mission, then it is irrelevant how other people are &#8220;relative to me&#8221;- instead, it&#8217;s in my interest to enrich as many people as possible. Then we can party on the future international space stations. Then I can have this conversation with myself (and you, if you&#8217;re so inclined) again&#8230; or maybe not. Who knows. Life is unpredictable.

Alright, I&#8217;m hitting my word vomit target for today in a matter of words. Now to have a kickass productive day at work. Cheerio.
