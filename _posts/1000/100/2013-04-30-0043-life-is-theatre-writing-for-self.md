  Life is theatre. All the world&#8217;s a stage. Everything we do is a part of the show, where we like it or not.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  We are all animals. We say it like it&#8217;s a bad thing, as if animals are somehow terrible creatures and we&#8217;re so much better than them.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Sure, we have more complex behavior. We&#8217;re capable of cruelty and kindness. No animal is kind towards its perceived enemies. Hyenas will rip out the guts of their living prey. See- temple grandis.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Dogs and cats are kind to us in large part because they&#8217;re domesticated creatures.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Reddit zoo accident- gorilla attacked another and raped it. Animals aren&#8217;t better creatures than humans. We will find acts of kindness and altruism. Cats grooming each other, animals morning each other. That&#8217;s a part of the social reality of things. But any animal that is kind in one setting can be gruesome in another.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Life is at once beautiful and horrible. Red in tooth and claw.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  We&#8217;re all seeking chemical effects in the brain. That&#8217;s why we like lolcats so much. That&#8217;s why we masturbate. That&#8217;s why we go clubbing. As a writer, I am not immune. Writing is one way I get my chemical fix.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  The interesting thing about humans is that we have the illusion of choice. We have the ability to do what oddyseus did- to prepare ourselves.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  We click on youtube links that have boobs on them, or titles like &#8220;banned advertisement&#8221; though we know it probably wasn&#8217;t. We didn&#8217;t have much choice in the matter. We get into arguments where we get more concerned with winning than with understanding each other. We&#8217;re animals. We have the  circuitry.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">

</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Today was not a great day at work. My colleagues are amazing, wonderful people and I have a fantastic work environment. I just haven&#8217;t fully learnt to work yet. And so I&#8217;m walking with cement in my shoes, in my Disneyland.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I need to learn the habit of practice and focus. I am repeating myself so thst this gets wired in my brain. My sleeping habits have improved. I no longer stay up all night for no reason. That&#8217;s progress.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I started a fitness routine. 20 pushups and 20 jump squats every morning, and every night. Everytime I do this, I write it down on my kitchen wall. This has worked out well for me. This is proving to do good things to my mental well being.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Incorporating fitness into my routine has made me more free. The challenge is to keep incorporating new routines into my life that further improve my freedom. I know what I must do, I just need to do it.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Damn, this is a crowded train.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I understand that I need to make the most of the littlw moments. The stars will never all align perfectly. The lights will never all turn green. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m writing this on the commute home. I have to squeeze out whatever&#8217;s in me at every opportunity I get.  need to surround myself with people that inspire and motivate me.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I need to get all these little niggling tasks out of the way. I&#8217;m passing a t-shirt to a guy- I&#8217;ve held onto it for months! I need to do a book review that I promised months ago, too. These thoughts perpetually weigh me down. I need to ship, ship, ship!
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Tomorrow morning I should go to work early. When I get home tonight I&#8217;m going to do my fitness routine. Publish 1 and schedule 1. Get plastic bags from downstairs? I need to meditate regularly and I need a clearer roadmap.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I&#8217;m going to read another chapter of thinking fast and slow. A chapter a day, a word vomit, fitness routine. These were the dailies I determined for myself a long time ago. I ended up starting with fitness. Now I&#8217;m moving to vomits and reading. If I maintain this for a week I&#8217;ll earn me some rewards.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Today at work I made tiny bits of progress on large tasks. This will not do. I need to implement strict pomodoro, for I am an animal that&#8217;s not to be trusted.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  When in doubt, meditate and refocus on your purpose. I think bookends will save me- routines that bookend my day. Because now I just have a routine of disorganized chaos and the value that comes out of that is a mere trickle.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Look to your fitness routine, visa. See how it is strengthening you. And apply it to other areas. We will rewire your brain for the better.
</p>

I just want to continue this so I can post it up- I&#8217;m really thinking about writing about some of my army memories, because I woke up early in the morning and was reminded of my early morning army memories. I&#8217;m really not sure anymore of what I should be doing, but was I ever, really?

When I first started out, I just blindly did whatever I felt ought to be done. I wrote about whatever I felt ought to be written about. As I progressed and got more public attention, the whole operation started to feel more &#8220;legitimate&#8221;, so I started feeling like I ought to be putting some thought into what I&#8217;m writing. It makes sense, right? When people start looking at what you&#8217;re doing, you should give them what they want to see or hear. We naturally have that tendency- we sit straighter and stand taller when we believe we&#8217;re being observed.

But I think there&#8217;s a certain crippling/chilling effect, too. I start thinking about what my audience needs, rather than what I personally feel like putting out. Sure, there&#8217;s a balance between the two. But it can&#8217;t begin from a place of &#8220;what does the audience need&#8221;, because then I neglect what is bursting from my heart, from my mind. And if I&#8217;m not in the right mood, if I&#8217;m not in a situation where I&#8217;m enjoying what I&#8217;m writing, then the audience won&#8217;t be feeling it either.

So this is ultimately why I&#8217;m doing what I&#8217;m doing- in this context, these word vomits- they aren&#8217;t for you, they&#8217;re for me- but me doing this for me will ultimately be good for you, too. That&#8217;s what I believe. It may not be immediately apparent. But that&#8217;s how I got here and I think that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m going to be moving forward.
