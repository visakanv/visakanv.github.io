Our vocabulary for addiction and personal change or development is so limited. It&#8217;s so simplistic and juvenile, and it&#8217;s somehow self-evident to me that if we improve the way we talk about these things, we improve the way we deal with them.

I think that&#8217;s because the inverse seems to be true- the more simplistically you talk about something- the more bluntly, the more we overgeneralize, the likelier we are to get things wrong. And we get things wrong in a very broad, blunt way. When we&#8217;re precise, we still get things wrong- in fact we can sometimes get things very, very wrong. But then we learn. This isn&#8217;t the case for broader strokes- we&#8217;re &#8220;somewhat in the ballpark&#8221;, and that&#8217;s &#8220;okay&#8221;. Â So there seems to me to be a relationship between the way we talk about something and the way we deal with it.

To be more precise- there&#8217;s a relationship between the way we talk and the way we think, and there&#8217;s another relationship between the way we think and the way we act. Ultimately we just want to improve the way we act, so we&#8217;re all better off, in whatever sense we want that to mean.

Anyway. I want to talk about cigarettes for a while. I&#8217;ve talked about them many times before, and I overdramatize them, but this is my blog and I want to talk about them so I&#8217;m going to talk about them. And let me illustrate the original point with a statement: It&#8217;s been about a week since my last cigarette.

That statement by itself doesn&#8217;t actually tell you very much. Am I trying to quit, or not? Was I a heavy smoker prior to that, or not? Most people won&#8217;t even really ask these questions- but then and again, to be fair, most people don&#8217;t really care. Other smokers or ex-smokers or on-again-off-again smokers might be interested, but even then that&#8217;s probably rooted in self-interest- we want to know how others are doing so that we can figure out &#8220;where we stand&#8221;. It&#8217;s insidious, how much we care about these things.

Erm&#8230; I realize that you can&#8217;t interrupt a word vomit. You have to go from start to finish. There&#8217;s a certain rhythm to it that you can&#8217;t mess up. The dots connect in a certain way, and then you have to follow the path. The path is set up semi-nicely, but it&#8217;s also temporary, and if you don&#8217;t start running on it immediately to light it up, it fades away, and you&#8217;ll forget what you were getting at, what you were going for, and you&#8217;re left with this sad and sorry memory of something that could&#8217;ve been.

It&#8217;ll be somewhat interesting to read my vomits on hindsight and see where they go. Anyway, I&#8217;m going to use the distraction as fuel- I got on Facebook and started scrolling back to see what I&#8217;ve done that was well-liked, well-responded to. I have a blogpost in me that I&#8217;m saving up called confessions of an ex-facebook addict. Or something like that. We&#8217;ll cross that bridge when we come to it.

I&#8217;ve said that there are certain similarities between cigarette addiction and Facebook, and games- all of them are games in a certain way, and Facebook is a lot about identity creation- you want to find out who you are, in the context of the people of your life. I caught myself scrolling back through my old status updates and shares to see what people respond to- because in a small way people are a representation of reality, of &#8220;the market&#8221;, of &#8220;nature&#8221;. It&#8217;s like doing comedy- you might find all of your own jokes funny, but you also want to see what people laugh at. (Reminder: Louis CK&#8217;s description of what he did to be like George Carlin is one of the most powerful things I&#8217;ve ever seen, and it&#8217;s very compelling and it speaks to me as a creator of some sort. That&#8217;s how you create- you have to discard. You have to kill your babies. It&#8217;s way, way harder than it sounds.)

Ermm&#8230;. shall I get back to smoking? I wanted to think of a dramatic way to say this but I&#8217;ll just lay out the facts in a boring way- I started fooling around with cigarettes at the end of 2006, early 2007, became a full on smoker around mid 2007, really really serious by 2008&#8230; I loved them, they meant something to me- they kept me company, they understood me, they let me express myself, they let me be me, blah blah. I happily smoked throughout 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012&#8230;. thousands of cigarettes (500 packs is 1,000). Thousands and thousands. I attempted to quit three or four times, and never really went more than three or four days- usually when I was really, really sick. (You don&#8217;t enjoy cigarettes when you&#8217;re horribly sick, so you might as well just not smoke- and at the end of the illness you&#8217;ve been smoke free for 4 or 5 days, so you might as well keep going. Some people might pull this off, but I think it&#8217;s not a sustainable strategy- one that&#8217;s likely to hit failure.)

To quit smoking you need to go into a very different place and build failsafes that&#8217;ll keep you there- the simplest version of this is a completely different way of looking at yourself, at cigarettes, at life and the world- but easy for me to say all this, I&#8217;ve never quit smoking. What makes me confident that I can, though, is that I quit Facebook (for about 3 months, fine), and going back to it makes me feel like it&#8217;s never going to be the same again, and that I&#8217;m going to have to leave forever. I&#8217;ve also broken ties with some really close friends- and ultimately that&#8217;s what quitting smoking is going to be like, leaving an abusive relationship. And that&#8217;s much easier said than done, because abusive relationships are never 100% bad. In fact that 50% or less of good in the relationship is going to look better than most of the shitty good in the rest of the world.

Not happy with this vomit, but I&#8217;m just going to ship it and start another one. Why? I don&#8217;t know, I just feel like it.
