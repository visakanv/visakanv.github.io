  I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m just tired, but I just erased the past two starts I made at doing this vomit. This is of course counter to the very spirit of the vomits- I&#8217;m supposed to just blurt out whatever is on my mind, and leave it at that. I find myself struggling to let go of the idea that there&#8217;s going to be an audience reading this, now that the last post got so much attention. I find myself trying to sound clever, as I used to do on Facebook and still sometimes do on Quora. I think the solution to this is to address myself. So I&#8217;ll do that.</p>

    Visa, listen to me. You&#8217;ve spent a lot of time stuck in this rut. You&#8217;ve actually been in this rut your whole life, as far as you can remember. It&#8217;s already starting to get a little boring. You can&#8217;t still be writing about this 100 vomits from now. Seriously, 100,000 words of apology can&#8217;t be very interesting. So let&#8217;s run through your thoughts.

    Okay. I think I was reasonably productive at work today. I wasn&#8217;t overly distracted by anything. But I wasn&#8217;t super productive either. Most of the blogpost draft that I did at work was written as a word vomit on the way home from work yesterday. Well, whatever works. Seriously, whatever works. Just write and get it out. I should use the computer without any internet access, and block periods of time out.
  </p>

    I&#8217;m experimenting with beeminder. Turns out I actually started an account back when I wanted to track my studying for my A levels, but I have up because it seemed a little too complicated for my liking. Or maybe I simply wasn&#8217;t ready then. I wrote a vomit this morning, so that&#8217;s one data point for Write. I&#8217;m writing this one now, so that&#8217;s another data point for when I get home. I&#8217;m feeling better from the flu I had,  so I&#8217;m going to exercise when I get home. That&#8217;s a data point for exercise. I used to sort of use a sort of similar system with pen and paper when I was doing my military service,  but it all fell apart when I lost my notebook.
  </p>

    I have many, many more pieces of writing to do. Should I do sub-points for completing drafts or outlines of things that I intend to write? I have a piece for Poached due, and one for a friend&#8217;s magazine, and a neverending strean of work for&#8230; work. These vomits are personal, for my own pleasure and personal improvement. If nothing else, my vomits during my morning commutes are things that I&#8217;m going to stick to.

    I&#8217;ve gotten a bunch of responses and emails from people who are in similar positions as I am, or are interested in the possible solution to the problem I&#8217;ve described. I think this makes it exciting. It&#8217;s like getting an A2A on Quora- I feel obliged to make progress now, at least for others. If I can help others get through their problems by solving my own, I think I should. I think that&#8217;s great motivation. I think we&#8217;re a big family around the world who understand each other more than our own friends and family do, and I think we should support and look out for each other. And the way this works is, of course, as it does with oxygen masks on planes- we have to put our own on before we can help others.
  </p>

  <p>
    So that&#8217;s the plan, then. I have to put my mask on so I can help others. I might be stricken with existential woe, but it doesn&#8217;t matter- I need to get my mask on so I can help others. There are people out there who will benefit from my help if I develop myself into the individual who is capable of helping them. It might be more technically accurate to say that we can&#8217;t help others, we merely inspire them to help themselves&#8230; through our example. One person&#8217;s greatness inspires another to give herself permission to do the same.

    The problem is that the status quo seems so&#8230; tolerable. The enemy of the great is not the bad, but the good enough.

    Why am I reciting all this nonsense? Everybody has heard it all before.

    Anyway, yeah, I&#8217;ve started using Beeminder.i sort of had something similar going with HabitRPG, but the constant bugs were problematic for me. Also the bars weren&#8217;t quite right. I can&#8217;t explain it. I&#8217;m really tired. Blood sugar level low. I should never go more than 4 or 5 hours without eating.

  This is what you call a really, really weak word vomit. I ended at 768 words when I got home (Though I probably deleted about 300). Realistically I could stop here and rest assured that the times I went way, way over 1,000 would cover for me, but I don&#8217;t like the idea of not meeting 1,000 on any of my vomits, so I&#8217;m going to take this one stream of consciousness and carry it all the way into the net.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  So- I&#8217;ve started up beeminder, and the goals i&#8217;m tracking are- exercise (sets of pushups and squats, simple enough), writing (word vomits count as one, work posts i think count as 1.5 or 2- this is my second vomit of the day), i&#8217;m also going to track meditation (5 minutes a day, min 3x a week) and reading (any book, 3x a week). That might be a bit too much. I don&#8217;t know. My brain is overly empty. It&#8217;s 11:55pm. I&#8217;m going to go to bed. Tomorrow will be better.

  Ermmm I guess I could talk about how I logged into Facebook and saw a discussion going on about education and the cure to cancer. I deliberated responding to it- I wrote a response out, edited it a couple of times, but ultimately decided against it. I don&#8217;t want to publish anything publicly on Facebook in terms of statuses, yadda yadda. If I have something I want to say to someone on Facebook, I&#8217;m going to do it via private message. That&#8217;s just how I&#8217;m going to roll, and it has to do with my &#8220;path of least resistance&#8221; idea. I shouldn&#8217;t be spending time on that, anyway. I think I&#8217;m going to deactivate my fb account again. Once you&#8217;ve been away from it for a while, everything looks utterly vacuous.

  but you could say that for a lot of things. anyway, i just had to coast this one through. pretty sad that such a nice number got such a shitty vomit, but such is life. no regrets. done is better than perfect. see ya.
