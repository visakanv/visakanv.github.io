Wow, I haven&#8217;t done a word vomit in a really long time. It&#8217;s been almost two or three weeks. That&#8217;s a little bit embarrassing. I quite certainly fell off the bandwagon there. What has remained unchanged, though, is how I feel about it. I feel that it&#8217;s necessary, something that I need to do. And so I am doing it. I may not be entirely on track. But I am doing it. And I must keep doing it.

It&#8217;s interesting to pay attention to how easy it is to make excuses. Some of them are valid, but then and again- if you want something badly enough, you&#8217;ll fight to keep it alive. A huge part of it is about being smart- about paying attention to your environment, about changing your environment to suit your goals and intentions- because whether we realize it or not, we certainly do respond to the setting that we are in.

I also realize that I have to make time to do this, rather than wait for it, or hope for it. I&#8217;m squeezing it out now while she takes a shower before we head off. Why not, you know? It might not be the perfect time but there&#8217;s never a perfect time. You just gotta do what needs to be done.

I wasn&#8217;t expecting to be in the position that I&#8217;m in right now. I was hoping to get a job with SIA as cabin crew, as an air steward. I reasoned that it was the perfect job- I would be able to travel, the salary&#8217;s pretty high considering the qualifications required, and I would have downtime between trips to do all the writing I&#8217;ve been intending to do.

Again, I create this condition where I count on an ideal situation to manifest itself before I can write. That&#8217;s not how it works. You have to write no matter what. That&#8217;s the deal.

I got employed. I got headhunted by a tech startup, and today was my first day of work. I enjoyed it very much. I haven&#8217;t completely dived into the deep end yet, but I love what I see. I think the startup working environment is near-ideal for me. I almost didn&#8217;t want to go home at the end of the day, because I was working on something that I found interesting. I actually found myself wanting to stay, to finish what I was doing. If I didn&#8217;t have other things to worry about, I&#8217;d probably have ended up staying there until midnight, and find myself stranded with no way home except an expensive cab ride home.

But that kind of excites me. I think that&#8217;s a good thing, it&#8217;s wonderful to be in a situation where you love your work so much that you can lose yourself in it. Of course, one should always take pains to ensure that she doesn&#8217;t sacrifice her life for her work. Well, unless the work is more important than her life. There may be situations like that. But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the position I&#8217;m in. I think that it&#8217;s much easier to hold yourself in check while in the midst of something you love- as opposed to trying to get interested and excited about things you don&#8217;t really care too much about.

She described to me today her frustration and general mental exhaustion from dealing with her current working arrangement. It reminds me of my experience as a storeman and general-purpose pinball during national service. Now that I have had some time to reflect on my experiences, I realize that Basic Training (which I uniquely only got to do towards the end of my military service) was the most meaningful and enjoyable part of my entire NS experience. Yes, I had less free time, but there was something about it- being a part of a unit, having a schedule to follow (and making it), getting things done together, knowing in advance what needs to be done- it was physically tiring but it was a beautiful experience.

In contrast, being a storeman-in-limbo was mentally exhausting. I&#8217;m not saying that being a storeman itself is exhausting- what was exhausting about my unique circumstances is that it was never clear how long I was going to be staying in any particular position for any period of time. While I was with the Commandos, I couldn&#8217;t fully invest in my experience because I knew I would have to leave sooner or later- I just didn&#8217;t know when. Same thing happened over and over again as I got posted around. I couldn&#8217;t set roots in any particular unit (though I still have a soft spot for my very first HQ CDO family).

I feel for military brats and other kids that have to travel regularly/endlessly, never being able to take root anywhere. (Though I suppose if you&#8217;re travelling around with the same people, you&#8217;ll at least be able to take comfort in your relationships with them- in my case I was being bounced around a large organization and my teammates and superiors would change every time. I learnt to detach myself from my experiences.

I enjoyed all the little interactions I had with all the men (and women) I encountered with over the years- I&#8217;ve been reading Jane Jacobs and she describes how, when a street kid gets disciplined or scolded by a public figure (like the owner of a shop), not only does he learn to avoid trouble, he learns that there are people out there who care about what happens to him. And this is a sort of social, public education that you can&#8217;t pay people to give- because it&#8217;s the concern or interest of people who AREN&#8217;T being paid to take care of you- that creates the intended educational effect.

Similarly, my NS experiences taught me that most of us are quite alright, we all have the same hopes and dreams and fears&#8230;

I didn&#8217;t finish this, I had to go away halfway. But This will make it cross 1,000, and I got to keep going. Keep going.
