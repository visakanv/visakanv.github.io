I have been feeling slightly blocked for a while- though perhaps it might be more accurate to say that I am slightly blocked most of the time and that I have occasional moments of clarity. I haven&#8217;t been doing these vomits regularly in a while. Won&#8217;t try to explain it, just poor flow/energy management.

<div>
  <span style="font-size: 16px;">I&#8217;ve been reading. I read all of Ender&#8217;s Game in a day. A respected friend recommended it to me once and I mentally put it in my &#8220;maybe read someday if the opportunity presents itself&#8221; list. Then I started work and a colleague used the author&#8217;s name as a skype handle. I asked about it in some random conversation and more than a couple of colleagues said it was great. Now I really had to read it. If I got the chance. I still wasn&#8217;t about to go looking for it or buy it, I was too busy with work. Then me and my wife found the book in one of those free library book exchange type things. I had to have it.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: 16px;"> It sat on my shelf for a few days and then I picked it up. I skimmed a few pages before bed. I read it on the way to work, and on the way home. Then I stayed up until 330am, finishing it in a single sitting as my wife lay asleep next to me. I tossed and turned as I read, book up, book down. Was so thankful for the adjustable reading lights my wife bought us. (I think there&#8217;s really something about how you need to move around to properly absorb something. Which makes sitting still in a classroom or lecture a really bad idea.)</span>
</div>

It occurred to me that I hadn&#8217;t done that in a really long time. The last books I remember devouring like that were the Harry Potter series. Since then maybe the Lord of the Rings, Carl Sagan&#8217;s biography, Soul Made Flesh, The Black Swan and Antifragile, Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s books (particularly Outliers), The User Illusion,Â  Lost Illusions&#8230; okay, a few books. But the point is that I read vociferously as a child- obsessively, like an alcoholic. I&#8217;d wake up and read until my mom demanded I shower, and I&#8217;d read in bed until my sister demanded I turn off the light. (When you grow older, she told me, you&#8217;ll wish you had time to sleep.)

I&#8217;m probably romanticizing this. I remember reading a Roald Dahl book while sprawled out on my sofa. I remember reading Enid Blyton books my mom got me, in my parents room. I remember reading a thick The Dark Is Rising tome at some boring wedding. Read a large chunk of the Mahabaratha at some temple event. Finished a buddy&#8217;s copy of Norwegian Wood over stolen breaks while at Pulau Tekong. Remember borrowing books about volcanoes and hurricanes and tornados, and pyramids and mummies and dinosaurs.

The library was a wonderland before the internet. I borrowed books about chess and video games. I had books on HTML, Java, C++&#8230; though I never properly learnt anything other than the first. I remember reading The Golden Compass&#8230; I think during primary school. The Pearl for a secondary school assignment. Charlotte&#8217;s Web, Friedrich, a Wrinkle in Time. Flowers for Algernon. I remember a book called When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit. Another rather weird one called Finn Family Moomintroll. I remember reading about knights. I remember a collection of Aesop&#8217;s fables and I remember reading an older version of Aladdin over and over again. There was something about trees with jewels in it. I remember reading about cars and trains and engines and planes, asteroids, meteors, cells, bones, carnivorous plants.

<div>
  <span style="font-size: 16px;">Anyway the point is that reading was a big part of my life- and a very valuable part too, I think. And I&#8217;m excited to revisit that. I think getting off Facebook helps. I think having a bookshelf and not having a TV helps. Having a laptop doesn&#8217;t help. Haha. But I want to read. I want to break past my current plateau. I think there could be a lot of value in intelligent quotes and reviews of good books.</span>
</div>

Writing&#8217;s important too. I had to take a break from Poached magazine for a while because I honestly felt like I had nothing useful to say. I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted people to think or talk about. Writing is a form of inquiry- what do you do when your inquiring leads you to the realization that you ought to shut up for a while? Well, that&#8217;s what I did. I think there is great value in decoupling oneself from the hustle and bustle of immediate relations and familar habits. I think I need to travel. Whatever it takes to break out of established routines so you can make yourself uncomfortable. In a positive sense, where you&#8217;re forced to pay attention to your surroundings, to your self.

I think I&#8217;m becoming a better writer. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll show in these vomits but I think I see it in my work. I was looking at a draft of a blogpost I had written in February and I was disgusted with how meandering and rambly it was. I was trying to impress by bringing in all these slightly-interesting tangential facts while neglecting the central hook. Story of my life, maybe. Fixation with icing, neglecting the actual cake. That&#8217;s how I survived for a long time so I have to rewire my brain at a very fundamental level. I thought I made progress and indeed I might have, but the challenge remains undiminished. I have to bash myself against this wall like I might in a video game. I have to believe.

I had a thought about smoking and smokers and general procrastination or impulsiveness&#8230; something in there is about a lack of faith in the self and a lack of faith in the future. At some level it might be &#8220;tomorrow me will take care of it&#8221;. But that doesn&#8217;t seem like a real conviction, a sincere belief. It&#8217;s just lip service. If you sit a procrastinator down and point out their past history of failure, and they&#8217;re intelligent (as many procrastinators disproportionately are, I&#8217;m sure), they&#8217;ll have to admit it: they can&#8217;t be trusted. Procrastination is not very different from substance abuse. I think so because of the parallels in my experiments with reducing smoking, Facebook and procrastination. I&#8217;m not sure what these precisely are, maybe I&#8217;m imagining it. But they all involve certain conceptions of the present and the future in a way that&#8217;s irrational from a global perspective, yet seems to make sense in a local, present perspective. There seems to be a &#8220;get this pleasure now while it&#8217;s guaranteed because you don&#8217;t know how fucked up the future might be&#8221;. The influence of the present on the future is vastly underestimated, even altogether ignored.

At work now. To be continued.
