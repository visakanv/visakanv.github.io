Have been a bit sleep deprived or something the past couple of days. Maybe dehydrated too. Wasn&#8217;t very productive at work. This is frustrating because I love my work, I should be progressing much faster! I don&#8217;t really even feel like writing this but I know that I will feel better if I stick with it so I&#8217;m just going to blaze through this one right now.

I repeat myself a lot and it&#8217;s frustrating that repetition is so necessary. Latest thoughts are the importance of repetition and constant refinement, constant pruning, constant revisiting. I&#8217;ve reduced significant amounts of background noise from my life by keeping my email inboxes empty (work and personal.) I still have a shitload of nonsense to declutter from my home PC and from my bookmarks at work, my google drive and evernote.

I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;m going to get rid of my pen-and-paper notebooks. I&#8217;ve developed an emotional attachment to them and the idea of throwing them away is painful, but it&#8217;s morw painful to have so much in my cup that I can&#8217;t fill it up with what matters the most in the immediate. I&#8217;m doing whatever is easy and seemingly urgent rather than what is genuinely important.

I think I&#8217;ve made significant progress by getting off Facebook- that&#8217;s a very real win and sticking with it is good for me. I will not be going back on Facebook until I&#8217;ve sufficiently emptied everything else that I want to do. This could take years- so be it. That&#8217;s a price worth paying if it helps me so the things I consciously want to do.

Far too often I find myself swept away in the currents of the unimportant- today I found myself on tumblr and Reddit. Sure some of it is interesting and potentially useful information down the road- but it&#8217;s not a priority. If I were the boss of me I&#8217;d ban myself from all these distractions for a few months at least. That&#8217;s a funny thought experiment because I AM the boss of me. I&#8217;m just a shitty boss. Becoming a better boss (within the mind) seems to require mindfulness, meditation, regular breaks to refocus on what is important.

I shouldn&#8217;t spend too much time figuring this out- that&#8217;s another form of distraction, artificial busyness that doesn&#8217;t result in useful or meaningful work done. It&#8217;s the equivalent of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. I should be getting into a life boat instead. Dramatic shifts are sometimes necessary- keyhole surgery. Slightly traumatic but contained and ultimately for the best. At the very least it would be interesting. I must revisit my local/global optima realization and take significant leaps away from my status quo.

I must realize that it&#8217;s always relatively trivial for me to return to my previous state if I really need/want to. I have to triumph over the psychological crutches and bullshit that my mind comes up with to try and keep me stuck in the present state of ennui. I am doing work but I can&#8217;t shake the feeling that I could be doing a lot more. There&#8217;s no magic solution, it just takes grit and some mental clarity.

The little things go a long way. Baby steps blah blah blah. Need to cut things away. I&#8217;m on the train now, reaching bishan soon. There I change train to yishun. Buy dinner for self and the wife. Then take the bus home. Once home I&#8217;ll put away the phone and spend time with the wife. Shower first, then dinner. After that I&#8217;ll&#8230; tidy up computer 1 tomato, cull evernote 1 tomato, cull blog drafts 1 tomato, clean the house 1 tomato.

I just ran from the circle line part of bishan to the red line bit to get my heart rate up. I&#8217;m definitely lacking in some high intensity physical activity. Time to start doing more pushups and squats again to kick up the heart rate. I don&#8217;t even care about looks anymore, I just want to experience a superior state of flow. I want to focus harder and get individual tasks done. I find myself dissatisfied with most if not all productivity apps. I find don&#8217;t break the chain too simple and I find too many things too complex.

The best thing that works for me is actually pen and paper but that&#8217;s tedious to carry around with me all the time. I have a smartphone all the time now so whatever tracking I do should be done on this device. I&#8217;m not entirely sure what I don&#8217;t like about all the available apps. I think done works better than to do. I have a habit of getting complacent with my todos, and many of them have been stuck in limbo for months. I started a mailing list on my blog several months ago and about 30 to 40 people signed up but I still haven&#8217;t sent a single email. It&#8217;s the perfectionist bug- I&#8217;m so anxious to send something great that nothing&#8217;s good enough and nothing gets sent.

But do I really need to email anybody? I started the list thinking that it would inspire me to write things that I wouldn&#8217;t otherwise feel comfortable writing on my blog, but a strange thing happened- Everytime I think of something to tell my mailing list, I end up figuring out a way to write it on my blog instead. I suppose the best use the list will have will be for me to ask people for advice and input and opinions- how can I help you? But I don&#8217;t really have the space to help people- I have to help myself. You have to put your own mask on before you can help others and so I&#8217;ve got to keep this train chugging. I wonder how many posts in will I be when I have conquered this pwraonal demon- I mean, I know that the quest for self-refinement and self-actualization is never-ending, but surely there are milestones. You can always get fitter, but there are milestones.

So what&#8217;s a milestone for me? Maybe I should take a moment to redefine this because you can&#8217;t go somewhere if you don&#8217;t know where it is, at least vaguely. Well I&#8217;ve had a pretty good vague idea so far, so time to make it precise.

What I&#8217;m doing is waging a war against anxiety and mediocrity. This war won&#8217;t be won just by throwing myself at the enemy hard once or twice- it requires a sustainable strategy and economy. Supply chains. Logistics. Communications. This battle is a tough and complex one- essentially a counter-insurgency. Let me look that shit up.

EDIT: Went home at this stage. Did not look that shit up. Will now look that shit up and write about it next.
