I was writing a blogpost for work earlier today – and during my research phase I found myself effectively plotting the outline for something that could&#8217;ve been 10,000 words or more. This amused me. I&#8217;ve been writing blogposts for work for 4 years now, and yet I haven&#8217;t figured out a simple, sticky system for making sure that a blogpost is properly designed for reader consumption. This strikes me as a glaring flaw in my skillset that ought to be fixed.

When I think about this I realize that this is a symptom of a much bigger problem I&#8217;ve had all my life – my inability to make good projections about things. Lots of people post on Twitter and Tumblr and Reddit about how they have similar problems, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that everybody has the same problem – there&#8217;s a selection bias there. [1]

Anyway, the point is that I really ought to fix this problem in order to live a better life. A lot of the stress in my life comes from bad planning, from saying yes to things that I cannot handle, from drawing up projects and scopes in my head that are far bigger than necessary – often perhaps because it&#8217;s never clear to me what &#8220;enough&#8221; is. I&#8217;m recalling know a funny-sad conversation I had with my wife about work, when she asked me &#8220;how do you know when you&#8217;re done? what does done mean?&#8221; and I didn&#8217;t have an answer. I suppose in the absence of an answer, the real always was &#8220;I&#8217;m done when I&#8217;m utterly exhausted, when I&#8217;ve overshot the deadline and I&#8217;ve disappointed myself and everybody who was foolish enough to give me any semblance of responsibility.&#8221;

This is not a way to live. Life is too short to be spent agonizing internally about things that the world doesn&#8217;t actually care about. \[2\] \[3\]

So (and I&#8217;m certain I&#8217;ve said this before in a much earlier vomit, but it bears repeating) I need to get in the habit of delivering on what was initially promised. A problem here is that initial promises are often vague. So I need to take into account the amount of time and resources I have to get any particular thing done. A decent blogpost on any given topic shouldn&#8217;t have to be more than 1,000 words. It shouldn&#8217;t have to quote more than 10 people. Once you get into that territory you&#8217;re working on something more substantial. Which is fine, but you need to be clear with yourself that that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re doing.

I find myself thinking now about Carl Zimmer&#8217;s point, about how writing is like building a ship in a bottle. You do a ton of research and reading, and you have all that information in your head about everything there is to know about a topic – but then you try to start writing and you&#8217;re stuck in all sorts of contortions, because it&#8217;s simply impossible to convey that much information one word at a time in a series of a few thousand words. All the research really lets you do is figure out the story that you want to tell. And that story is necessarily going to be a mere shadow of what&#8217;s inside your head. You have to be okay with that, really early on. And you have to be prepared to discard and start over.

I believe there&#8217;s a school of thought in programming or some form of project management that you should plan to throw your first iteration away, since you&#8217;re probably going to end up having to do it anyway. This reduces the stress and anxiety you&#8217;ll have when trying to figure out precisely when you should start over. Da Vinci said that all art is merely abandoned, never finished. But this process of abandonment shouldn&#8217;t have to be so agonizing. As creatives we should know how to be ruthless without breaking our hearts at every single instance of iteration.

I haven&#8217;t been writing as many word vomits as I&#8217;d like, as frequently as I&#8217;d like. I still haven&#8217;t quite figured out how I&#8217;m supposed to feel about it. A part of me feels that I should obviously be shipping at least one vomit a day, however bad it gets. That&#8217;s the professional thing to do, and I want to be professional. So I&#8217;m not going to make excuses for that. I&#8217;m just going to describe how it feels to do it, so that I can understand my situation better and subsequently (I hope) perform better as well. The reason I&#8217;m slow with publishing vomits is because I&#8217;m not clear about the scope of what I should be writing in a given vomit. Sometimes it feels like I&#8217;m almost always writing inside my head, even when I&#8217;m not writing in a text editor or on pen and paper. That &#8220;writing&#8221; happens in a very subconscious way – just ideas moving around inside my head, shuffling back and forth, almost imperceptibly. I don&#8217;t actually know what is going on. But if I sit down with the word processor, I feel stuck.

(Is this true? Is this really true? How often do I really sit down with the intention of writing? I think I might be making excuses for myself here. I think if I really sit down – if I tell myself that I need to write something in half an hour&#8217;s time or else – then I&#8217;ll have something lined up inside my head. What I do know is that this process makes demands of the subconscious.)

So I do need to sit down and write every day. At least going through the process of a thousand words a day I think gives me a sense of what can be achieved in a few minutes in a given space. Anyway, tonight I&#8217;m hoping to crank a few out. It&#8217;s now 840pm. Let&#8217;s go.

[1] People with our specific problem seem to have a propensity to talk about the problem that we have. And we dominate online conversational spaces, so we&#8217;re definitely overrepresented. You don&#8217;t hear from the people who are quietly going about their lives, getting shit done. All conversational space is dominated by edge cases – you never see &#8220;dog bites man&#8221; as a headline, only &#8220;man bites dog&#8221;. And so it&#8217;s easy to infer, erroneously, that there are all sorts of epidemics of dog-biting men.

[2] And the world cares about some really silly things, too. But you get the idea.

[3] I&#8217;ve enjoyed the past couple of uses of footnotes. My mind has a habit of thinking divergently and exploring those offshoots of thought. This sometimes leads to something better than what I had originally set out to do. But it more often than not leads to a lot of frustration and anxiety.
